	<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
	<UL>
		<LI>Improved removal of old HPROF files</LI>
		<LI>Alarms
			<LI>Bugfix: Alarms may be canceled to early, if for example any 'timout' happened when the CM refreshed it's data (or other errors happened)</LI>
			<UL>
				<LI>New: AlarmEventClientErrorMsg           -- If the AseSqlCapture part sees an Error Number that is severe, then raise alarm.</LI>
				<LI>new: AlarmEventClientErrorMsgRate       -- If we receive "bursts" of Client Error Messages (more than 10 per second), raise alarm.</LI>
				<LI>new: AlarmEventSqlCaptureOldData        -- If SqlCapture has "died" for some reason (not updating a timestamp), then raise alarm.</LI>
				<LI>new: AlarmEventPerfCounterWarning       -- (SQL-Server) - If a PerfCounter value is "out of whack"...</LI>
				<LI>new: AlarmEventLongRunningStatement     -- If a Statement has been running for more than X seconds/minutes/hours</LI>
				<LI>new: AlarmEventExtensiveUsage           -- for example if tempdb is heavely used</LI>
				<LI>new: AlarmEventStackDump                -- for SQL-Server only: Sends the StackDump as a chunk of text</LI>
				<LI>new: AlarmEventOsSwapping               -- if IN or OUT is above 5000. For Linux/Unix it's in 'CmOsVmstat', for Windows it's in 'CmOsMeminfo', also include a small chart of last 15 minutes</LI>
				<LI>new: AlarmEventDbccCheckdbAge           -- for SQL Server, when dbcc checkdb hasn't been executed. </LI>
				<LI>new: AlarmEventHoldingLocksWhileWaitForClientInput -- When a SPID has started a transaction, but been idle at the Client side for more than X seconds. </LI>
				<LI>new: AlarmEventBackgroundMessage        -- ASE for errorlog messages starting with 'background task message:', which probably is a threshold procedure output. </LI>
				<LI>new: AlarmEventOldIncrementalBackup     -- SQL Server, old incremental backups </LI>
				<LI>new: AlarmEventDbNotInHadr              -- SQL Serverif we have any databases in HADR (Availability Groups) new databases should possibly be in there to... </LI>
				<LI>new: AlarmEventDatabaseOption           -- When a database option is changed (right now: only for Sybase ASE)</LI>
				
				<LI>Changed: AlarmEventConfigResourceIsLow       -- added "raiseDelay", which is used by 'Statement Cache Hit Rate', and the default was set to 5 minutes below configured value before raising alarm.</LI>
				<LI>Changed: AlarmEventFullTranLog               -- alwaysSend() is now set to true, so even if we do not "subscribe" for alarms on this server, we will still get message, just like SrvDown </LI>

				<LI>Changed: AlarmEventOldTranLogBackup          -- added lastBackupStartTime to the alarm message</LI>
				<LI>Changed: AlarmEventLongRunningTransaction    -- Changed from Severity WARNING to INFO</LI>
				<LI>Changed: AlarmEventHttpDestinationDown       -- bugfix: was never canceled (it was kept due to 'hasUndergoneAlarmDetection' checks)</LI>
				<LI>Changed: AlarmEventBlockingLockAlarm         -- Added SPID to key, so we can have multiple alarms on blocking locks</LI>
				<LI>Changed: AlarmEventOsSwapping                -- Have a Max value where we "cap" off at, so that peaks will be removed and we see a Average without peeaks (the calculation is 1.5 of the threshold value)</LI>

				<LI>Added section in "Recording Info": 1: If the HostMonitoring is enabled. 2: Hostname for the HostMonitoring. 3: If HostMonitoring is NOT Enabled, then write some info about <b>how</b> to enable it., and if it's Windows... Print some extra information about how to install SSH Server etc.</LI>
				<LI>Charts (for HTML Page is now using, ChartJS, which means we can hide some labels, get tool tip etc), The images are still keps as a fallback for mail content or other readers that do not have JavaScript access.</LI>

		</LI>
		<LI>DBMS Config: now you can do 'difference check', with a UI where you can see any difference (You can check with another-dbms-instance or a saved-recording)<br>
		    This is a really nice feature to check for new config parameters in different releases, and also to check if someone has changed config since "any recording YYYY-MM-DD"<br>
		    You can also generate DDL - Data Definition Language to "change/sync" the configuration... (but PLEASE double check values before applying them), and for the moment this is only enabled for "Sybase ASE" and Oracle<br>
		    </LI>
		<LI>Daily Report: section was rewritten to be a more "modular".</LI>
		<LI>Daily Report: can be saved in a directory, so we can view the reports from DbxCentral Web Interface. properties 'DailySummaryReport.save=true|false', 'DailySummaryReport.remove.after.days=##', DailySummaryReport.save.dir=path, the files will be deleted after 60 days or (DailySummaryReport.remove.after.days=60)</LI>
		<LI>Daily Report: new Sender type 'NoOp' -- which enables us to "do not send anywhere", but instead just SAVE the HTML report</LI>

		<LI>H2 shutdown. Added "default" shutdown method. which is used any normal shutdown. (previously IMMEDIATELY was used, which didn't flush down some stuff to the H2 storage)</LI>
		<LI>in GUI Mode: when an Alarm is Raised, you will now get a popup (similar to when you have blocking locks, long transactions...)</LI>
		<LI>AlarmView Dialog - now also works in offline mode</LI>
		<LI>OS Host Monitoring - iostat: improved iostat number of columns parsing (in some cases the iostat version was unpredictable, for how many columns we would expect from iostat)<br>
		                         &emsp;Now I try to "count" number of columns returned at startup do: ioStatColCount=$(iostat -xdk | grep 'Device:' | wc -w); echo "ioStatColCount=${ioStatColCount}")</LI>
		<LI>OS Host Monitoring - DiskSpace: some systems printed long lines into 2 or several rows (added -P option to 'df')</LI>
		<LI>Sends Alarm if DbxCentral are down (default after 15 minutes)</LI>
		<LI>AlarmWriterToMail: small modification to get SSL/TSL (to live.com) to work</LI>
		<LI>Internal re-make of DBMS Quoted Identifier Characters. Source code SQL Statements should use [identifier].<br>
		    The Writers/Readers then translates the right/left brackets to use DBMS Specific chars: MySQL=`, mostOthers=", SQL-Server=[], SybaseASE=[], SqlAnywhere=[]<br>
		    The DBMS Specific char is fetched from the JDBC MetaData methods. and there is are methods with DbxConnection that ca "quotify" SQL Strings (which replaces the [] into correct chars)<br>
		   </LI>
		<LI>Host Monitoring: Negative Diff Counters did not work as expected</LI>
		<LI>CmOsDiskSpace: Now has 3 graphs (Space Used MB/Pct, Space Available MB) so we can follow space usage on a longer term basis (if sent to DbxCentral)</LI>
		<LI>CmOsDiskSpace: Better alarm handling (now all mount points are automatically checked, for PercentUsage=95% &amp; LessThanMbLeft=10)</LI>

				<LI>DDL Lookup: 'Database Object', 'Statement Cache' can individually be enabled/disabled</LI>
			</ul>
		</LI>
		<LI>Performance Counter Panels: added shortcut ctrl-1 = view ABS Counter, ctrl-2 = view DIFF Counters, ctrl-3 = view RATE Counters</LI>
		<LI>Tooltip on Cells in CounterModel - You can choose to see 'PK' or 'ALL' columns, you can also set if it should be a Focusable ToolTip (change settings with right click, context menu)</LI>
		<li>View DBMS Configuration for all vendors: Changed most fields to be "editable", to make it easier to copy information from the cells</li>
		<li>PCS: Print statistics about H2 performance after a entry has been stored</li>
		<li>PCS: DDL Lookup, options to enable/disable Lokkup/Storage of 'Database Objects' and 'Statement Cache Entries' DDL</li>
		<li>PCS: H2 extra property "dbxtune.h2.url.extra" to add/override various H2 URL Properties</li>
		<li>PCS: New Persistent Counter Store -- InfluxDB (https://www.influxdata.com/) is a Time Series database that stores Trend Graphs for any DbxTune collector</li>
		<li>PCS: some work to make the PCS modules and DBMS Configuration more DBMS Vendor independent (create table data type, and Quoted Identifiers enhancements)</li>
		<li>PCS: Daily Reports are now done in background, with the previous period (prev day) database. When it's done, the shutdown defrag will be done.</li>
		<li>PCS: setting H2 option 'REUSE_SPACE=FALSE', which means that A LOT MORE disk space will be used for database storage (default is REUSE_SPACE=TRUE).<br> 
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; But less CPU/IO will be done (due to 'DB garbage cleanup' is disabled).<br> 
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Note: this is a temporary workaround until H2 becomes better at this.<br> 
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The DB Size will be 'shrinked' (by shutdown defrag) by the 'CentralH2Defrag at 04:00', or when the collector does a database 'rollover' at midnight.<br>
		</li>
		<li>Graph properties, for DbxCentral Web interface... so we can individually decide Graphs Label Sizes, yAxisScaleLabels (KB MB, GB, Seconds, etc...)<br>
		    This is described as a JSON object, example: {"yAxisScaleLabels":{"name":"mb","s0":" MB", "s1":" GB", "s2":" TB", "s3":" PB", "s4":" EB"}}</li>
		<LI>CmIoStat: added chart 'iostat: Read &amp; Write Operations(readsPerSec+writesPerSec) per Device &amp; sec', which has 'readsPerSec' and 'writesPerSec' combined.</LI>
		<li>All DbxTools does now have a Version Sensitive Information in the Counter Controller Property Dialog</li>
		<li>remove file produced by '-XX:HeapDumpPath=path' after 7 days, not to fill up disk space.</li>
		<li>NoGui: Changing configuration files will be automatically picked up (objects must read from the Configuration object to see the new values)</li>
		<li>collector 'CmOsIostat' which is part of all DbxTune collectors: send alarm 'AlarmEventOsDiskUtilPct' -- if OS Disk has been busy for for a long time (something strange is happening, like write cache has been disabled due to low voltage on battery)</li>
		<li>Trend Graph Panel - In the properties dialog, double click on a row, and it will move to the selected graph in the panel and "blink" it for 5 seconds, so it's easy to find graphs</li>
		<li>Host monitoring: iostat, now supports version 11.5.7, which intruduced/changed some columns</li>
		<li>Right click context menu: had some problems if the columns was re-ordered</li>
		<li>Introduced Dictionary Compression functionality (which basically is a normilization, a key/value storage with a md5/sha1/sha256 key so that we only store "common" strings *once* in the PCS (for some columns)... (see each xxxTune application for more info)</li>
		<li>Create 'User Defined Counter' Wizard: enhanced it to use JDBC dataypes for User Defined Graphs (for example in Postgres it wasn't possible to create User Defined graphs due to this)</li>
		<LI>
			<b>Upgraded some of the third party libraries/jars</b><br>

	<H3>Generic - Changes that affects all DbxTune tools</H3>
	<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
	<UL>
		<LI>Moved into one common configuration file: dbxtune.properties, instead of {product}tune.properties<br>
			The user file is still individual for all different tools: {product}tune.user.properties<br>
			The save file is still individual for all different tools: {product}tune.save.properties</LI>
		<LI>All CM tabs now also has a filter field where you can enter SQL syntax to filter what you want to se in the JTable<br>
			This does NOT affect the SQL Statement issued to the server, it only filters in the local in-memory JTable</LI>
		<LI>Exception text are now stored in a recording so it can be displayed when we view the data later</LI>
		<LI>CM Dependencies has been improved: if we view a tab that depends on some else CM, the dependant CM will be refreshed...</LI>
		<LI>Warning popups on 'Full Translog', 'Oldest Open Tran', 'Lock Waits' will only popup on <b>new</b> occations (so we can dismiss them, and get a new popup next time we got problems)</LI>
		<LI>Alarm system has been implemeted (mainly for <b>NO-GUI mode</b>), where you can have AlarmWriters, which sends Alarms to various implementations.<br>
			You can set Alarm Thresholds at: menu-&gt;View-&gt;Change Alarm Options... and in the Wizard 'Create record session - template file Wizard...'<br>
			In the above dialog you can create "user defined alarm logic", which consists of java code that is compiled "on the fly" (so it's java as a script language)<br>
			To view Active/Historical Alarm, menu-&gt;View-&gt;Alarm Active/History<br>
			<br>
			The following Alarm Writers has been created, the idea is to use them in 'NO-GUI' mode (but they will work in GUI mode as well)

			Some alarms specific for RepServer: RsDbQueueSize, RsMemoryUsage, RsReplicationAge, RsSdUsage, RsWsState
			<br>
			</LI>
		<LI>NO-GUI Mode: if no password has been specified for DBMS/SSH (-P, -p or in the config file), get the password from the file $HOME/.passwd.enc (which is encrypted passwords using opensll)</LI>
		<LI>NO-GUI Mode: You can specify a logname for each of the no-gui collector processes (if you have several on the same machine). Use -L logFileName</LI>
		<LI>SSH Key File improvements for all tools. Use: -k filename</LI>
		<LI>All Graphs now has '(TabName-&gt;CmName)' so it's easier to identify from where the information originates</LI>
		<LI>Memory settings setting dialog for 'Max Memory' and 'Garbage Collection'. In this dialog you can specify your own values.</LI>
		<LI>The "postpone" functionality can be temporaraly be enabled/disabled with a checkbox without changing the postpone time</LI>
		<LI>Host Monitoring: The os utilities can output different number of columns, in different versions of the utilities. Now it handles the different versions.
			Also better internationalization for numbers and time. <br>
			On startup it will print the utility version.
			</LI>
		<LI>Tail of log files, now has filters that you can apply to discard some records (good for RepServer and other log files, which generates a lot of output)</LI>
		<LI>New Counter Collector, HostMonitoring: Memory Information, which gets information from /proc/meminfo</LI>
		<LI>Changing local home directory from '~/.asetune' to '~/.dbxtune'</LI>
		<LI>config and log files changed from '~/.asetune' to '~/.dbxtune/conf' and '~/.dbxtune/log'</LI>
		<LI>Some new command line switches: '-a|--createAppDir', '-A|--serverAlias', '-O|--urlOptions'... mainly for no-gui</LI>
		<LI>Connection Dialog: set/change the DBXTUNE_SAVE_DIR in the dialog</LI>
		<LI>Connection Dialog: button to create a new Profile</LI>
		<LI>Connection Dialog: Made number of items before scroll, in the JDBC Driver drop-down larger.</LI>
		<LI>DDL View: Added search field/dialog</LI>
		<LI>Better handling of 'SrvDown', send to DbxCentral</LI>
		<LI>Wizard: Create 'Record Session - template File'<br>Added page: Send Daily Report, with a bunch of configuration options</LI>
		<LI>PCS: Persistent Counter Storage - Also writing Active Alarms to the Recording PCS Database</LI>
		<LI>PCS: You can specify 'PersistWriterJdbc.h2.shutdown.type=DEFRAG|COMPACT|IMMEDIATELY', where DEFRAG is default, and if you want to do that in a background thread 'PersistWriterJdbc.h2.shutdown.inBgThread=true|false', where 'true' is default.</LI>
		<LI>PCS: In no-gui mode, if the disk becomes full, then DbxTune will stop... since it can't save any data...</LI>
		<LI>PCS: Create a Daily Report and send... For the moment it will only send Current Active and All Alarms that has been generated during that day. In the future it might me more sophisticated, and try to figure out recommendations for various SQL Statements or DBMS Configurations.</LI>

		<LI>Probably a bunch of other stuff, which I can't remember...</LI>

	<H3>DbxCentral - The central WEB console to view Trend Graphs</H3>
	<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
	<UL>
		<LI><b>This is a total new functionality</b>, and it's here where a lot off hours has been spent...</LI>
		<LI>See a preview of this at <a href="http://gorans.org:8080">http://gorans.org:8080</a><br>
		    Please be gentle with the environment, it's only trying to give you a preview...<br>
		    The preview environment is currently having:<br>
		    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 - different versions of ASE (12.5.4, 15.5, 15.7 &amp; 16.0)<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - SQL-Server 2017 (Running on Linux)<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - Postgres, Version 9.5<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - MySQL, Version 5.7<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Missing pieces are: RepServer,RAX, IQ, Oracle, DB2 &amp; HANA<br>
			Note 1: The ASE 15.5 version currently has a alarm/warning active to illustrate how alarms is displayed.<br>
			Note 2: Nothing is really happening on any of the DBMS instances, so do not expect any fancy graph activity... It's just NO-GUI collectors sampling idle DBMS Instances
		   </LI>
		<LI>All dbxTune collectors can now send the "trend graph" information to a Central Server, which can/will store the data for a longer time.
		    The default retention period is 1 year.</LI>
		<LI>Trend Graphs can be viewed from "any" web browser, by "anyone" (except the old Microsoft Internet Explorer)
            This will enable developers to find potential performance problems while testing/developing.</LI>
		<LI>Trend graph updates are "pushed" from the web server to the browser via web sockets (so no need to refresh every x second)</LI>
		<LI>To view all <b>details</b> about a recording you will still have to use the "fat" GUI,  the current GUI implementation
            (but you can remote-connect to the recorded database, which is stored on the DbxCentral host)</LI>
		<LI>If all collectors are also running on the same host as DbxCentral, it will also delete old recordings based on how
            much space we got left on the file system, and prediction of how much recording space we will need for next 2 days.</LI>
		<LI>Alarm information is also sent from the collectors to DbxCentral, so we can see if we are having active alarms for specific servers</LI>
		<LI>The Alarm information is also stored, so we can later on check what alarms we had, and for how long they were active</LI>
		<LI><b>This is in BETA mode for the moment, instructions for how to set this up is in a separate file... see README_dbxcentral_install.txt<br>
		    Please send feedback on this functionality when you test it or start to use it</b>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: Engines</b><br>
	When you use ASE 15.7 and using 'threaded kernel mode' CPU Usage calculation gets a bit <i>strange</i>, this due to including IOCPUTime in the calculation.<br>
	This manifests itself as a <b>higher</b> CPU usages than it really is, because <b>all</b> engines will have a high IOCPUTime even if it's only one engine/SPID that
	the IO originates from. The IO is done by the IOController but the counter IOCPUTime is <i>faulty</i> increased on <b>all</b> engines.<br>
	By the way this might be fixed by ASE CR#757246 in the future<br>
	<br>
	A CheckBox '<code>Collapse IOCPUTime into IdleCPUTime</code>' was introduced, so you can decide if you want to <i>disregard</i> the column IOCPUTime in the calculations. Or actually
	move/collapse the IOCPUTime counter into the IdleCPUTime counter.<br>
	Note: this CheckBox is only visible if you run ASE 15.7 and if you are in process kernel mode, the CheckBox will be disabled.<br>
	<br>
	Also added the following columns, while the old columns 'CPUTime', 'SystemCPUTime', 'UserCPUTime', 'IOCPUTime' and 'IdleCPUTime' are now <i>just</i> difference counters.
	<ul>
	   <li>NonIdleCPUTimePct - Formula: (SystemCPUTime + UserCPUTime [ + IOCPUTime]) / CPUTime * 100.0</li>
	   <li>SystemCPUTimePct  - Formula: SystemCPUTime / CPUTime * 100.0</li>
	   <li>UserCPUTimePct    - Formula: UserCPUTime   / CPUTime * 100.0</li>
	   <li>IOCPUTimePct      - Formula: IOCPUTime     / CPUTime * 100.0</li>
	   <li>IdleCPUTimePct    - Formula: IdleCPUTime   / CPUTime * 100.0</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: Wait</b><br>
	Added WaitTimePerWait to the local graphs...<br>
	Also enabled the CheckBox 'Include [250] waiting for incoming network data in graph
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: SPID Wait</b><br>
	Added local graphs... More or less the same graphs as in the 'Wait' tab.<br>
	<ul>
	   <li>Summary Graphs on EventID - WaitTime, Waits, WaitTimePerWait (all records is summarized over EventID)</li>
	   <li>Summary Graphs on ClassName - WaitTime, Waits, WaitTimePerWait (all records is summarized over ClassName)</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: Summary Tab</b><br>
	Multiple columns for the Summary Graphs (graphs side-by-side)<br>
	Five new Trend Graphs
	<ul>
	   <li>Server Waits group by 'EventID'   (Choose one of the following data source <code>WaitTime|Wiats|<b>WaitTimePerWait</b></code>)</li>
	   <li>Server Waits group by 'ClassName' (Choose one of the following data source <code>WaitTime|Wiats|<b>WaitTimePerWait</b></code>)</li>
	   <li>SPID Waits group by 'EventID'     (Choose one of the following data source <code>WaitTime|Wiats|<b>WaitTimePerWait</b></code>)</li>
	   <li>SPID Waits group by 'ClassName'   (Choose one of the following data source <code>WaitTime|Wiats|<b>WaitTimePerWait</b></code>)</li>
	   <li>Connection Attempts Per Second (source @@connections)</li>
	</ul>
	Mark field 'Lock waits', 'Full Transaction Logs' and 'Oldest Open Tran' as red when there is problems with any of them<br>
    <br>
	Added entries to Graphs sub menu
	<ul>
		<li> "Reset/Clear this Graph" - Clears the graph from data </li>
		<li> "Set Max Values, in Y Axis..." </li>
	</ul>
	Also added a secondary time-line-ruler, with the color "light gray".<br>
	On single click, it will be visible/enabled on all graphs (hopefully on the same time)<br>
	To disable/hide it click on a point where the line is enabled/visible.<br>
	</LI>


	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: System Load</b><br>
	Three new graphs
	<ul>
	   <li>Outstanding IO's, When the refresh happened, Per Engine</li>
	   <li>Outstanding IO's, Average over last minute, Per Engine</li>
	   <li>Outstanding IO's, Summary for all instances</li>
	</ul>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: Databases</b><br>
	Some new columns
	<ul>
	   <li>LogSizeFreeInMbDiff  - Same as LogSizeFreeInMb, but the difference from previous sample</li>
	   <li>DataSizeInMb         - How much Data is allocated in MB for this database</li>
	   <li>DataSizeFreeInMb     - How much Data are we NOT using in MB</li>
	   <li>DataSizeFreeInMbDiff - Same as DataSizeFreeInMbDiff, but the difference from previous sample</li>
	   <li>DataSizeUsedPct      - How much Data are we using in Percent</li>
	   <li>SPID                 - duplicate of OldestTranSpid, to enable table right click menu</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: Temp Db</b><br>
	Some new columns
	<ul>
	   <li>LockContPct    - Percent Calculation of Lock Contention</li>
	   <li>CatLockContPct - Percent Calculation of Catalog Lock Contention</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: Summary Panel</b><br>
	New field 'UTC Time Diff', which just prints out the time difference in minutes to UTC Data<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: Objects, Cached Objects</b><br>
	In the GUI Panel you can now limit number of records fetched from the server.<br>
	This is of interest if you have thousands of tables, and it takes a <b>long time</b> to fetch the rows.<br>
	The limitation is done <b>after</b> the <code>order by</code> has been applied...<br>
	And the <code>order by</code> for the Counter Models are:
	<ul>
	   <li>Objects        - <code>order by LogicalReads desc</code></li>
	   <li>Cached Objects - <code>order by CachedKB desc</code></li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: IO Controller</b><br>
	Two new graphs
	<ul>
	   <li>Pending IO's, or number of outstanding IO's</li>
	   <li>Completed IO's per seconds</li>
	</ul>
	Also removed column Pending from being difference calculated, it seems that it's a peek counter.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: Spinlock Sum</b><br>
	Handle counter overflow in a better way.<br>
	Algorithm bumping up to a higher datatype: and adding the negative delta on top of Integer.MAX_VALUE<br>
	SQL: CASE WHEN (value < 0) THEN @int_max + (value - @int_min) ELSE convert(bigint, value) END -- @int_min/max is bigint <br>
	Also at the client side, try to do a better job when the higher datatype (unsigned int) gets wrapped but NOT cleared.<br>
       Algorithm ASE 12.5:  diffColVal = new BigDecimal((maxUnsignedInt - prevColVal.doubleValue()) + newColVal.doubleValue() + 1); <br>
       Algorithm ASE >= 15: diffColVal = new Long((maxUnsignedInt - prevColVal.longValue()) + newColVal.longValue() + 1); <br>
    If the underlying counters are cleared, the sample interval is adjusted to reflect <b>when</b> the counters where cleared and the values will start at zero (as it's a counter reset)<br>
    The goal is to eliminate problems with Counter Wrapping and Counter Resets...<br>
    So even when it happens, the counters in the "difference calculated" values should reflect the actual DIFFERENCE from previous sample<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: Objects Tab</b><br>
	a new local checkbox 'Include System Tables'<br>
	This checkbox sends 'dbcc trace{on|off}(3650)' to the server to include system tables in monOpenObjectActivity<br>
	Note: it doesn't check if the traceflag is on/off for every sample, it just sends 'on/off' when you press the checkbox.<br>
	When the Performance Counter initializes, it will set traceflag 3650 on if it was enabled last time you used AseTune (it will not turn it of)<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: Sysmon Raw</b><br>
	Implemented 3 new sysmon sections
	<ul>
	   <li>Disk I/O Management</li>
	   <li>Network I/O Management</li>
	   <li>Monitor Access to Executing SQL</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: All Performance Counters</b><br>
    If counters has been cleared (for example by sp_sysmon or someone else externally)<br>
    Then set the field 'Clear time' background color to orange<br>
    If we are viewing a recorded session, the colored field will instead be 'Head time' <br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Java Garbage Collection: Enhancements</b><br>
	<ul>
	    <li>Make Java Garbage Collection every X minute, the default is set to 10 minutes<br>
	        This can be enabled/disabled from view-&gt;Preferences, the interval can also be changed from here.</li>
	    <li>Do not show "GUI progress" if the AseTune window is not activated<br>
            This means: the user is not "disturbed" if he are working in another window</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: pause/refresh button</b><br>
	If you are in paused mode, F5 or the "refresh" button will still work<br>
	So if you want to do "refresh" to capture a specific user event, this is now a bit easier.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement to tool: SQL Capture</b><br>
	The tool can now be reached from all the JTable right click menus that has SPID columns in it.<br>
	Previously this was only enabled when KPID was available.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>NEW Standalone tool: tailw</b><br>
	This is the same tool as within AeTune and SqlWindow, but now as a standalone utility.<br>
	Start it using 'tailw.bat' or 'tailw.sh'<br>
	With the tool you can tail any file, local or remote.<br>
	When using the remote tail, SSH connection is used to read/stream to the client side, which probably is on windows.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: Connection Dialog</b><br>
	Connection Profile: this will make it a bit easier to connect...<br>
	A Tree View in a new panel, located to the left of the connection attributes can be enabled.<br>
    The connection dialog will be used for both the AseTune and SqlWindow applications<br>
    To enable/disable the Tree View Panel, there are two buttons on the bottom left corner.<br>
    A Connection Profiles can also be selected from a Drop Down Box, called "Use Profile"<br>
    New Connection Profiles is "automatically" created after a connection has been successfully established, it will ask you for
    a name... if you change some attributes and connect, a dialog will be asking you if you want to save it or not.<br>
    Another way to Save/Create a Profile is by pressing 'Save Profile...'<br>
    * The SSH Connection Stuff now also takes a 'init OS Command', so you can kick off a OS command when the SSH connects
      this can then kick of a shell scripts, which may 'setup a new SSH Tunnel Connection chain' or setup some environment, or...<br>
    * JCheckbox option to enable jConnect Password Encryption over the network<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: Connection Dialog</b><br>
	When you successfully has connect via host:port and the entry is NOT part of the interfaces file<br>
    Show a popup that ask you if you want to add the entry to the interfaces file<br>
    If the current interfaces is not writable, then an option to copy the current interfaces to a local/private files will be displayed<br>
    If you open the interfaces file for EDIT, and it's not writable offer the above "copy option"<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: Connection Dialog</b><br>
	Also added a new option "Use Counter Template", and a list of templates you can choose from...<br>
	When using this option, the predefined template will be used, which mean you can have different predefined Performance
	Counter Sets for different servers, and when you connect that Counter Template will automatically be used.<br>
	Maintaining Template Sets is done in the existing dialog  'Settings for All Collector Tabs', which you can open by clicking 'Template Dialog'<br>
	This dialog can also be reached "at any time" from the Main Menu-&gt;View-&gt;Change 'Performance Counter' Options...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: View ASE Configuration</b><br>
	Added 1 tab: ASE Config File - Tries to read the ASE configuration file. This will use CIS and needs configuration 'enable file access' to be enabled
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement - Stacktrace analyzer</b><br>
	Right click menu: Stack Matrix Table<br>
	In the 'Stack Matrix Table' Dialog you can navigate within the stacktrace samples to:
	<ul>
	   <li>Select a specific sample, then look at the <i>source</i> content in the stack file for that sample.</li>
	   <li>Highlight what other samples the current KPID, SPID or SUID is active in.</li>
	   <li>What KPID, SPID, SUID or TABLE-OBJECT is the most active within the whole sampled stacktrace session.</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>SQL Window: Enhancements</b><br>
	<ul>
	   <li>Option: How long does a SQL Statement takes from the clients perspective.<br>
	       Client Exec Time: %MM:%SS.%ms (sqlExec=%MM:%SS.%ms, readResults=%MM:%SS.%ms)</li>
	   <li>Added sub command 'wait #ms' to the 'go' terminator.<br>
	       <b>Example:</b> <code>go 10 wait 100</code> will execute the SQL batch 10 times, and wait 100 ms after each SQL batch has been sent.</li>
	   <li>The progress dialog, now updates 'SQL Batch' timing when you use multi execution 'go 20'</li>
	   <li>Code completion works a bit better, especially for dbname.dbo.&lt;ctrl-space&gt; (cross database lookups,
           but there are still <b>more</b> to do with code completion, I would like to parse the SQL to figure out "where"
           we are located in the SQL Statement, and from there decide more about what to display... anyone that has a good parser for this...)</li>
       <li>Tooltip Supplier: Some support for ASE/HANA = "hover" over a function or other SQL Statement, if there
           are help for it a tooltip will popup with some help (I need to do RepServer here, but it�s just
           a XML file with textual description...<br>
           and also on the "todo" list is to display table/column help... hover over a tablename = get column descriptions for that table)</li>
       <li>Error hint: On any error messages, try to <b>mark</b> them with red underline + "red cross" on the
           left hand side (at the line number) + red snivel to the right of the scrollbar
           (this is <b>really</b> usefull when coding multiple functions/procedures in the same file,
           Usually you have to "guess" what line in the file the error is at, multiple 'go' will cause the location problem)</li>
       <li>ASE variable/identifier "marker" = put cursor on a identifier/variable = all other vars/tables/cols/etc with the same name will be "highlighted"</li>
       <li>More information about the connected database in the status bar (especially when using the "generic" JDBC connection)</li>
       <li>If you edit a file and another application changes the file, a popup will ask if you want to "reload" the file (cooperate with another editor)</li>
       <li>Option to save the file before sending the SQL to the server. (good if you want to cooperate with another editor)</li>
       <li>Option to restore the window size/location based on the connected server name. (after connect the window will be moved/resized)</li>

       <li>Copy Results button: right click to choose format you want to copy it as (if you just press the button, last used method will be used)</li>
       <li>JTable: in the right click menu: "Execute content of selected rows" (hover of it = will show the SQL that will be executed):
           good for generating SQL and execute it�. Ex: select "select tabName='"+name+"', rowc=count(*) from "+name from sysobjects where type = 'U'</li>
       <li>\call, \exec and \rpc now works a bit better (for ASE, IQ, SA, RS, MS-SQL) The return code is automatically fetched
           the CallableStament will be like '{?=call procname(params)}' for others it will be '{call procname(params)}'.<br>
           This makes it possible to receive output parameters for variables that vendors that does not have the return code.<br>
           Example of calling a stored proc with output params is HANA "\call procname('in-a', ?) :(string=null out)"</li>

       <li>On errors, two buttons will be visible: 'next' and 'previous', which will move the cursor to the SQL Text where the error happened</li>
       <li>If you click on a (error) message in the output window, the cursor will be moved in the SQL Text, which was responsible for the error message.</li>
       <li>Command History: If the SQL Text is to big do not add it to the history. (default is 5K, 5120 bytes, which can be changed with property 'CommandHistory.entry.limit.size=sizeInBytes')</li>
       <li>Command History: added filter field to search the history</li>
       <li>Command History: The Command column isn't "over sized" anymore... This simply means: it's less annoying when you have any wide commands in the history</li>
       <li>Added ASE Set option 'set statistics *_html', which enables/disables ALL options for HTML Statistics output.</li>
       <li>After the sql.ini/interfaces file has been changed via the "edit" button: Select the last edited entry as the new server.</li>
       <li>Client character set can be chosen via a ComboBox, it will simply update the 'URL Options' field.</li>
       <li>Favorite SQL/RCL button now you can execute commands directly from the dialog, and the dialog isn't modal anymore.</li>

           <li>Append results (just keep appending to the output, usable if you want to compare some results, from 2 different executions)</li>
           <li>Limit the ResultSet to # rows, or simply stop reading rows in a ResultSet after # rows. And a dialog to configure this.</li>
           <li>Show sent SQL (more or less same as �e in isql)</li>
           <li>Print ResultSet info (print out what JDBC think it will receive, java.sql.Types.VARCHAR, varchar(30), makes it easier to verify some stuff)</li>
           <li>Client timing (how long did the query take from the client side, SQL Execution, Read ResultSet), tooltip will show the SQL that was executed.</li>
           <li>Send using �;� (good if you are used to Oracle, this is a bit limited, or not 100% compatible with sqlPlus)</li>
           <li>If connected to Oracle: enable/reads the dbms_output subsystem</li>
           <li>On errors within stored procedures, get the SP Text and mark the "error" row with red. The text is displayed in the tooltip of the error.</li>
           <li>Code Completion: Finer control of what to get/refresh</li>
           <li>ToolTip Supplier, option to enable/disable column/parameter lookup to Code Completion</li>
           <li>Ability to change JDBC AutoCommit, this is hidden, but can be enabled with property 'QueryWindow.jdbc.autoCommit.show=true'</li>

	AseTune internal parsing of the @@version string to an integer was previously 5 numbers (15034 = 15.0.3 ESD#4),
	the new internal representation is an integer that consists of 7 numbers (1570042 = 15.7.0 ESD#4.2, 1570100 = 15.7 SP100, 1570101 = 15.7 SP101)<br>

	<b>Bug fix: Performance Counter 'Threads' - missing records</b><br>
	This problem has only been seen if ASE runs on the Windows platform.<br>
	To few records in the Performance Counter. This was due to a bad join from monThread to monTask<br>
	The join towards monTask is only to distinguage syb_system_pool:NetController and syb_system_pool:DiskController<br>
	Now using a outer join to get records that doesn't have a record in monTask<br>
	monThread.KTID *= monTask.KTID: the KTID in monTask only has a matching KTID for currently running SPID/Threads
	but the rest of the "engine" threads has no matching entry in monTask, because they are not executing anything.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancements to Graphs attached to the Performance Counter 'Threads'</b><br>
	The labels for the '<i>CPU Thread BusyTicksPct Average per Pool Type</i>' now contains how many threads it averages on.<br>
	The labels for the '<i>CPU Thread BusyTicksPct Usage per Thread</i>' now reflects the "thread number" within the <code>ThreadPoolNameType</code> instead of the <code>ThreadID</code> this makes it a bit more readable I hope.<br>

	a small shell script <i>template</i> is also available. But the shell script has to be created executed by <i>you</i>.
	Then FTP the output and read the file using this tool.<br>
	If this tool will be used a lot, then I will need to implement a SSH execution of the script and grab the output back to
	the local machine so you don't need to do all the above. Then the tool would be a bit more <i>automatic</i> if you <b>really</b>
	need that functionality, let me know and I will see what I can do!<br>

	The default was previously to: "Always show this dialog when this happens" and "Change focus to tab '???'"<br>

	   <li>Command history, which is persisted and shared between different Concurrent SQL Windows instances</li>
	   <li>Favorite SQL/RCL button now has the ability to add/change/remove your own SQL Favorites using a small dialog</li>
	   <li>If you want to connect to a JDBC source where the driver is <b>not</b> in the current classpath, a dialog has been created so you can add JDBC driver to the system without having to change the bat or shell file that started the SQL Window tool.</li>
	   <li>Open a new SQL Window tool, with that is connected to the same server. Use 'Clone Connect' in the menu.</li>
	   <li>Using Icons instead of text for the "Exec" and "GUI Showplan Exec"</li>
	   <li>Query Options has been put under a button/popup called "options", this to save some space.</li>
	   <li>in ASE 15.7 SP100 - HTML showplan has been added to the "Set" button and the HTML will be displayed as rendered a HTML page/output</li>
	   <li>Use "Drag and Drop" on the buttons "Exec" and "GUI Showplan Exec" to execute a SQL Statement. This will be usable from the <b>History window</b>, that is if you have two SQL Windows opened. But only one History Window... Then you can do "Drag" from the History Table and "Drop" on the SQL Windows "exec button" where you want it to be executed.</li>
	   <li>Simple '<b>grep</b>' functionality. do: <code>exec sp_who&lt;NL&gt;go | grep 'sa'</code> will do grep for 'sa' in the output from the resultset(s)</li>
	   <li>Simple '<b>bcp</b>' functionality. do: <code>select * from t1 where c1='x'&lt;NL&gt;go | bcp dbname.owner.desttab -Usa -Pxxx -STO_SRV </code> will try to BCP values into the table in the destination server.</li>
	   <li>Simple '<b>rpc</b>' functionality. do: <code>\exec|rpc sp_who ? :( string = '2' )</code> will try to do a RPC call to ASE using a JDBC CallableStatement to execute the procedure. In this example we call sp_who with a <i>string</i> parameter of value "2". This is also the only way to check return code and output parameters from a stored procedure.</li>

	<b>NO GUI mode - sleep interval enhancement - experimental</b><br>
	By using the property 'offline.script.waitForNextSample' you can add a Java Script that can decide when we want to do a new "refresh".<br>
	Example:<br>
	<pre>
		offline.script.waitForNextSample=function waitForNextSample(waitStartDate) \
		{ \
			var nowDate = new Date(); \
			var secOnTheMinute = nowDate.getSeconds(); \
			if (secOnTheMinute == 1) \
				return 0; \
			else \
				return 1000; \
		} \
		waitForNextSample(new Date(waitStartedAtTime));
	</pre>
	The above script returns 0 when clock has passed 1 second after each whole minute<br>
	If not just, return 1000, which means: let AseTune sleep for 1000 ms, then call this Java Script again.<br>
	Note: the variable <code>waitStartedAtTime</code> is set by AseTune to indicate what the time was after a complete refresh of counters.<br>
	<ul>
	   <li>return 0 = go and do refresh of counters</li>
	   <li>return a number = Tell AseTune to sleep for this amount of milliseconds before it will call the script again.</li>
	   <li>return anything else, like a string or nothing means: use the ordinary sleep time.</li>

	<b>Bug fix: Performance Counters initialized with wrong ASE release</b><br>
	When connecting to ASE Release 15.0.2 or higher, the ESD# was stripped of.<br>
	This was due to trusting the sp_version 'montables' information.<br>
	The 'montables' version string is not maintained with the same version string as 'installmaster'<br>
	Solution in ASE 15.0.2 or higher is to use the 'installmaster' entry instead of 'montables'<br>
	This bug was introduced in version '2013-02-25', and in my opinion so serious I needed to make a new release ASAP.<br>

	<ul>
	   <li>Connect to "any" JDBC driver (the driver must be in the CLASSPATH, at least for the moment, work in progress for this)</li>
	   <li>Save (SQL/RCL) text content to a file. Save As. Load a file. Last Used files... (see the File Menu)</li>
	   <li>Can now connect to Replication Server</li>
	   <li>Syntax highlighting for RCL - Replication Command Language</li>
	   <li>Basic Code Completion for Replication Server Commands and Connection names</li>
	   <li>View Current ASE Configuration has been added, if you are connected to ASE.</li>

	<b>Java Memory usage by AseTune</b><br>
	AseTune uses a lot of memory, first of all Swing consumes quite some memory,
	  then all data in the Performance Counters does take memory,
	  then that data is stored in the 'in-memory' history, so we can go back and view data that within the history limit (defaults to 10 minutes)<br>
	When not yet connected, I think I have decreased the memory usage a bit (some unnecessary calls to Swing was removed).<br>
	But when you are connected and sampling data, the only thing I can do is try to cleanup or give the Java Garbage Collector <i>hints</i> that it should go to work.<br>
	<br>
	The following strategies has been implemented...
	<ul>
	   <li>A memory monitor thread, that will check how much memory we have left every third second and take actions (see below).</li>
	   <li>On every data sample, also check if we are reaching "near end of memory" and take actions (see below).</li>
	   <li>If the Swing Event Dispatch Thread receives OutOfMemoryError a notification to the Memory Monitor is sent.</li>
	   <li>By Default the In-Memory storage is disabled. Or actually set to a low value (1 minute).</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	The following Actions is available for AseTune.
	<ul>
	   <li>
	      if <b>less than 130MB</b> left
	      <ul>
              <li>enable option 'Do Java Garbage Collect after counters has been refreshed'. <br><b>Note</b>: the GUI might be perceived as a bit slow/sluggish when it has to do all that extra extensive Java Memory Garbage Collections</li>
              <li>show a pop up message that the above has been enabled.</li>
              <li>This can be disabled again from Menu-&gt;View-&gt;Preference-&gt;Do Java Garbage Collect after counters has been refreshed</li>
	      </ul>
	   </li>
	   <li>
	      if <b>less than 30MB</b> left
	      <ul>
              <li>The 'in-memory' counter view is cleared</li>
              <li>The 'in-memory' counter history is set to a low value (typically 0 or 1 minute)</li>
              <li>Advice the Java Garbage Collector to clean up memory</li>
              <li>show a pop up message that this has been done.</li>
              <li>'in-memory' counter history, can be set back at the top of the summary, graphs panel. </li>
	      </ul>
	   </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	   The default threshold values can be changed in any of the properties files.<br>
	   Low-on-memory: <code>asetune.memory.monitor.threshold.low_on_memory.mb=newValueInMB</code><br>
	   Out-of-memory: <code>asetune.memory.monitor.threshold.out_of_memory.mb=newValueInMB</code><br>
	</p>
	<p>
	   When <i>'Do Java Garbage Collect after counters has been refreshed'</i> is enabled a small GUI pops up to tell
	   you what's it doing since it might be a time consuming task to do the Java Garbage Collection.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	   Please let me know if you still have memory issues.<br>
	   Or simply raise the JVM Parameter -Xmx####m to <b>as high as possible</b> values (see below for default values). This is done in the asetune.bat or asetune.sh script.
	     or by setting the environment variable <code>ASETUNE_JVM_MEMORY_PARAMS</code> to <code>-Xmx####m -Xms##m</code>
	</p>
	Also new default values for Java memory:
	<ul>
	   <li>32 bit JVM's will use 1024 as max memory (JVM switches: -Xmx1024m -Xms64m)</li>
	   <li>64 bit JVM's will use 2048 as max memory (JVM switches: -Xmx2048m -Xms64m)</li>

	<LI>
	<b>Connection Dialog Changes (added SSH Tunnel option)</b><br>
	Connecting to ASE can now be done over an SSH Tunnel, which is automatically setup from AseTune via any SSH Server.<br>
	This is used to simplify connecting to any ASE that is located on a "shielded" network.<br>
	An example could be if you sit on one network and want to connect a ASE that is on the development network,
	  and the firewall wont let you connect to the ASE port on the development net. As long as you can connect
	  to any host that has a SSH server on the development net, problem is solved by the SSH Port Forwarding
	  functionality. (or wait for the network administrators to open the port, if it's allowed)<br>
	Here is the "big picture" how it works
	<ul>
	  <li>Setting up a local listener port (for example 2955). </li>
	  <li>The ASE Client (AseTune) connect to localhost:2955. </li>
	  <li>The SSH connection tunnels/forwards the packets sent on localhost:2955 to an "intermediate" SSH Host (via port 22). </li>
	  <li>The SSH Daemon then opens a connection to the Destination host:port (lets say asedevhost:5000) and forwards the data traffic. </li>
	</ul>
	This means: as long you can connect to the "intermediate" SSH Host you can connect to a ASE located on <i>the other side</i>.<br>
	The above help text and a picture trying to explain it will be visible in the Connection-SSH Dialog.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: View -&gt; View/Tail the ASE Errolog</b><br>
	If you want to view/tail the ASE errorlog file directly (and not via the monErrorLog table)<br>
	This is a simple tail on the log file. If the log files is <b>not</b> located on the same machine, which
	you run AseTune on, a SSH (Secure Shell) connection is made to the remote machine to start the tail, the
	output of the tail is then streamed back to the "log viewer" GUI which just presents the data.<br>
	In fact, you can view/tail "any" file on the (remote) machine, not just the ASE server log.<br>
	The same functionality is available in the stand alone SQLWindow tool (sqlw.bat or sqlw.sh), which is
	perfect if you connect to Replication Server and want to view the (remote) RepServer log at the same time
	as you enter various commands.<br>

	</ul>
	In ASE 15.7 ESD#2, the granularity of IOTime is much better than in earlier releases where the resolution was 100ms<br>
	So that is why the Graphs for 'Device IO Service Time' based on monDeviceIO (CmDeviceIo) was introduced.<br>
	Also a bug or strange behavior was introduced in ASE 15.7 ESD#2 in table 'monIOQueue', column 'IOTime',
	where the IOTime seems to be incremented in some arbitrary larger number than milliseconds. This might be
	solved in next release (I think this is solved in ASE 15.7 ESD#4) so I didn't want change or remove the Graph connected to CmIoQueueSum...
	<p>
	In ASE 15.7 The 'CPU Thread BusyTicksPct' Graphs is a better CPU measurement when using Threaded Kernel.<br>
	The monEngine.IOCPUTime shown some kind of average from the 'DiskController' Thread.
	  Then the server looks like it's overloaded with IO even if you are just issuing a table scan from a single SPID.<br>
	Note: Watch out for 100% values from 'BusyTicks' for 'syb_blocking_pool' and 'syb_system_pool' (RTC pools 'Run To Completion') they are always 100% in first versions, this is fixed in ASE 15.7 ESD#3<br>
	I might release a new AseTune, when I know how to fix the issue in a better way. <b>Suggestions are always welcome</b>, since I don't have access to any <b>good or highly used</b> ASE Server for testing.

	<b>Bug fix: Spinlock Sum - for ASE Cluster Edition</b><br>
	Some values would end up as "duplicate" entries. In ASE-CE the field_id was reused for some counters. So the join was also done on field_name<br>
	Also the field_name 'fglockspins' can optionally be discarded.
	If you choose not to include 'fglockspins' in ASE-CE, the performance will hopefully be much better, number of records for 'fglockspins' could easily be more than 100000
	removing those entries from the calculation would speed it up. And since it's so <b>many</b> rows with those values, a average wouldn't say that much. (a high value in one or two 'fglockspins' would just average out on all the other rows.)

	Record a AseTune session on a ASE 15.7.0 ESD#2 was not working, which is now fixed.<br>
	The problem was that lct_admin() was returning 'unsigned int' and in previous releases
	it simply returned data type 'int'. If the storage engine (in this case H2) doesn't support
	data type 'unsigned int' the recoding failed.<br>

	This makes it a bit faster when using ASE as the Persistent Counter Storage<br>
	<b>Note:</b> Using H2 database for PCS is still the preferred choice, because it's <b>much</b> more lightweight
	and not 100% ACID, it flushes the data to disk at a later stage, which makes it a <b>much</b>
	faster choice when recording a session. And also the H2 database is probably located on your local PC
	so we don't store information on the same server as we are monitoring.

	<b>New Functionality: ASE Application Tracing</b><br>
	A new tool 'ASE Application Tracing', for details see http://www.sybase.com/files/White_Papers/ASE15-apptrace-070507-wp.pdf
	for more information how this works.<br>
	This is just a GUI on top of ASE 'set tracefile ...' functionality.<br>
	The add on for the GUI is that it can work with remote files, so you can start the trace on your
	local client (probably a PC), then if the ASE is located on a Unix/Linux host an Secure Shell SSH connection
	will be opened to do tail of the trace file. This makes it <b>much</b> easier to view the trace file.<br>
	Also current executed stored procedures etc will be fetch and displayed in the local interface<br>
	This is a really usefull tool if you want to trace what a specific SPID is doing in the server.<br>
	<b>Note:</b> This uses a lot of memory in the GUI... lets see if we can fix that in any future release.<br>

	Using Ctrl+Space you bring up SQL Code Completion, for table names and columns<br>
	For the moment I don't use a parser to check where in the SQL code you are, so for the moment
	it's kind off basic... Column completion work works in a limited way for table aliases.<br>
	Please report strange behavior...<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: DDL storage functionality</b><br>
	In some of the performance counters, get top 10, or all rows (DBName, ObjectName) and get various
	information from the ASE Server (sp_help/procText, sp__optdiag, sp_depends) on tables/procedures<br>
	If the table or procedure has dependencies to other tables/procedures, add q DDL request of those objects as well.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: Connection Dialog, PCS: now show DDL Lookup/Storage properties</b><br>

	<b>New: View DDL </b><br>
	The entries stored be the 'DDL storage functionality' can be viewed in a TreeTable,<br>
	Access the 'View DDL' from:
	<ul>
		<li>MainMenu -&gt; Tools -&gt; DDL Viewer</li>
		<li>Any Performance Counter: Right click menu -&gt; DDL Viewer</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Note:</b> For the moment 'DDL View' is only available in "offline" mode. In the future this
	could also be implemented for "online" access.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: Performance Counter 'SPID Waits'</b><br>
	Use this to track wait time for individual SPID's, There will be approximate 5-10 rows per SPID.
	So there could be quite a bunch of rows in this one...<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New functionality in Tab: Databases</b><br>
	A local bar graph "Transaction Log Space Usage in Percent". Colors of the bars
	(green = less than 80% usage, orange = between 80-90% usage, red = above 90% usage)<br>
	A Dialog has also been created to choose what databases should be part of both the local
	bar graph and the attached trend graphs. This is on the button "Set 'Graph' databases".<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New functionality in Tab: Sysmon Raw</b><br>
	Calculating some of the ordinary "sp_sysmon" calculation.<br>
	The goal is to present some kind of sp_sysmon report simulation in the "Extended Info Panel".<br>
	Maybe a TreeTable or similar will present the information, but a lot of work is still needed here.<br>
	For now: the information is printed as raw text, in the Extended Info Panel, which is located on the right hand side for the text report.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: Column in in 'Statement Cache Details'</b><br>
	In ASE 15.7, Show 'show_cached_plan_in_xml(SSQLID, 0)' in the details.<br>
	The information will be saved/displayed in raw XML format until a good reader is available.

	<b>Change: tab 'Objects': Column name 'ObjectName' was showing IndexName instead of table name</b><br>
	In AseTune Version 2011-09-30, 2.6.0: I changed to used <code>ObjectName</code> column instead of <code>ObjectName=object_name(...)</code><br>
	This was not so good since the "raw" <code>ObjectName</code> displayed the IndexName instead of table name, so <br>
	I changed it back to display the table name using <code>object_name(...)</code>, and also added a column (in ase 15.0.2 or higher)<br>
	that displays the IndexName. This will make it easier to filter and sort on table name.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: tab 'Objects': Added some columns</b><br>
	<ul>
	    <li>NumUsedPages - which just does: <code>data_pages(A.DBID, A.ObjectID, A.IndexID)</code></li>
	    <li>RowsPerPage - which calculates number of rows per page</li>
	    <li>Remark - which tries to figure out what is happening of with this object. is it a table scan, etc...</li>
	</ul>
	The above columns will make it easier to check if many LogicalReads "ok", meaning is this on a small or large table<br>
	This can be disabled/enabled from the Local Options, in the 'Objects' tab.
	Or from any of the configuration files, using property 'CMobjectActivity.TabRowCount=true|false'<br>
	<b>Note:</b>The column 'Remark' should be treaded as 'experimental', use tooltip on the cell to get more information about the remark.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: tab 'Proc Cache Memory Usage', now holds more values</b><br>
	Now we do outer join on monProcedureCacheModuleUsage *= monProcedureCacheMemoryUsage<br>
	This means that memory modules that does not have detailed sections, now is available by
	the 'head/main' section. For example Dynamic SQL, does NOT have any details, which made it
	a bit harder to read. But now these modules are also available in the details.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: Summary Panel, some negative counters to zero</b><br>
	In the summary panel, some counters that could turn negative are now reseted to zero<br>
	(Transactions, io_total_read, io_total_write, pack_received, pack_sent, packet_errors)<br>
	If the above counters goes negative trend graphs would be "unreadable"<br>
	while other columns should be able to turn negative like (Connections etc...)<br>

	<b>Add/Changes to: SQL Window, stand alone utility</b><br>
	When starting the SQL Window tool as an external java process, using sqlw.bat. A menu bar and

	<b>Change: Tool: SQL/Query Window</b><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Now has a "cancel" button, when a statement is executing</li>

	<ul>
		<li>New field to write "extra where clause, on active statements</li>
		<li>New field to write "order by, on active statements</li>
	</ul>
	If SQL error happens, the refresh will STOP and wait for you to fix any syntax errors in "where restrictions".<br>
	Last executed SQL statement can be viewed wit tooltip on the panel.<br>
	Note: This tool will be rewritten from scratch "soon"<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changed text in error message: Connection Dialog</b><br>
	Some users had problems connecting, simply due to a faulty password.<br>
	They just interpreted the "raw" JDBC error message in faulty way... It was to complicated<br>
	So I added extra text in case the main exception was 'JZ00L'.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: "Extended Info Panel" on all Performance Counter tabs.</b><br>
	The "Extended Info Panel" on each 'tab' has previously always been invisible/minimized. Now the
	divider location is saved to the user temporary properties. This so we can remember how
	large the Extended Info Panel is for the 'Databases' or other Performance Counter tabs.<br>

	<b>Change: all Performance Counters, right click menu</b><br>
	The context sensitive right click menu now has alternate column names and optional columns<br>
	This simply means that they will be enabled (available to click on) on more tabs.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Add Messages: Wait Event Dictionary</b><br>
	Added 5 new 'Wait Event Descriptions' from ASE Documentation 'Performance and Tuning Series: Monitoring Tables', Document ID 'DC00848-01-1570-01'<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>GUI Change: in all Performance Counters when reading offline database.</b><br>
	Previously the field 'Clear Time' was empty, this field is not visible in offline mode anymore<br>
	Instead a new field 'Head Time' is visible, so we can see that what head/main time this tab is
	displaying, this makes it easier to detect if we are looking at the correct data.<br>

	<b>Change: H2 PCS, Persist Counter Storage, connect properties</b><br>
	When recording a session in a H2 database, set some basic options if they are not part of the URL<br>
	<ul>
	    <li><code>DATABASE_TO_UPPER=false</code> - Do <b>not</b> convert Table and Column names to upper.</li>
	    <li><code>MAX_COMPACT_TIME=2000</code>   - The maximum time in milliseconds used to compact a database when closing.</li>
	</ul>
	Also setting some options in the database after connect<br>
	<ul>
	    <li><code>SET COMPRESS_LOB DEFLATE</code>       - Compress LOB Large OBjects, text/image fields.</li>
	    <li><code>SET DEFAULT_LOCK_TIMEOUT 15000</code> - Change the LOCK timeout to 15 seconds.</li>
	    <li><code>SET QUERY_TIMEOUT 15000</code>        - Change query timeout timeout to 15 seconds.</li>
	</ul>
	Also do '<code>SHUTDOWN COMPACT</code>' in method, stopServices()<br>
	The intention for these changes is that the database size will be smaller...<br>

	<b>New: Tooltip on SPID, in offline mode for all Performance Counter</b><br>
	Tooltip on SPID in JTable cells now work in offline mode as well<br>
	First it loads the 'Processes tab', then it check if the SPID is there and reads all the information.<br>
	If the 'Processes' is not saved, then the ordinary 'Not able to load...' will be displayed.<br>

	<b>bug fix: Tab Missing Statistics</b><br>
	This used to much CPU resources for checking if column was part of any index.<br>
	It uses a little less CPU now, but I still need to tune it in more detailed.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Tab Spinlock Sum</b><br>
	in pre 15.0 ASE, 'Arithmetic overflow occurred' could happen due to sum(many 'int' rows), now converting counters to numeric(12,0) before doing sum.<br>
	In ASE 15.0 and higher, convert to bigint is done<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Tab Processes</b><br>
	On highly utilized systems, timeouts happened. I guess this is due to joining with the monX proxy tables.<br>
	So now I snapshot monProcessActivity, monProcess, monProcessNetIO into temp tables and join from there.<br>

	<b>bug fix: Tab Summary, Databases: Timeout when creating new databases.</b><br>
	Added 'readpast' to sub selects on sysdatabases &amp; sysusages, this will hopefully just
	skipping reading this row from the ASE Version where locking schema 'datarows' has been
	used for System tables. If I remember correctly this is ASE 15.x<br>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Performance Counter Tables, save/restore column layout</b><br>
	Previously only 1 layout was saved, so if we connected to several different ASE versions, this wasn't working very well<br>
	Now only column layout will be saved for each ASE Server version.<br>
	</LI>

	<b>bug fix: Persistent Counter Storage, Strings can be overflowed.</b><br>
	When storing to long Strings in the PCS, in H2 we got Exception: org.h2.jdbc.JdbcBatchUpdateException: Value too long for column<br>
	Solution: If the string we are going to store is "longer" that the database allowed storage size, then
	truncate the end of the string (the part of the string that we want be able to store),
	and add '...' as a marker that is has been truncated.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Copy + Paste for to ascii table did not handle newLine.</b><br>
	Now the ascii table looks better if any "cell" has newlines in them<br>
	If this happens, I also add an extra vertical row separator, so it's easier to see where a new row starts<br>

	Changed the internal PrimaryKey from: '<code>[InstanceID,] ObjectName, DBName, IndexID</code>' to: '<code>[InstanceID,] ObjectID, DBID, IndexID</code>'.<br>
	Hopefully this will cause to less DuplicateKey errors.<br>

	<b>bug fix: Problems to login</b><br>
	When a user logs in, I check for 'mon_role' (and 'sybase_ts_role'), if user doesn't have those roles
	I will try to automatically grant those roles, if current user is authorized to do this.<br>
	Fix: current user should have 'sso_role' not 'sa_role' to do automatic grant.<br>

	<b>bug fix: check if connection is still open, done to often</b><br>
	This only means that the isOpen() check will hopefully already been done by the watchdog, which

	  <li>Local SQL filtering, just adds SQL to the where clause.</li>
	  <li>Drop/purge of current QP Metrics</li>
	  <li>Jumping directly to ASE Monitor Configuration Dialog</li>
	</ul>
	This is based on the white paper <A HREF="http://www.sybase.com/files/White_Papers/Sybase_ASE15_QMatrix_wp_021508.pdf">Performance Tuning in ASE 15 Using Query Processing Metrics</A>

	</TABLE>
	Note: I used a preliminary document for what's new on 15.7, so I have NOT tested this yet.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: in tab 'Databases', a new right click menu entry 'dump tran ${DBName} with truncate_only'</b><br>
	This makes it easier to truncate the transaction log in a specific database if we run out of space.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: in tab 'Databases', 4 new Columns 'DbSizeInMb', 'LogSizeInMb', 'LogSizeFreeInMb' and 'LogSizeUsedPct'</b><br>
	Also added 2 graph to keep track of "Log Space left in MB" and "Log Space used in PCT".<br>
	Databases in the attached Graphs can be excluded<br>
	Exclude a database from graphs is based on:
	<ul>
	    <li>Part of the skip list</li>
	    <li>Database size is lower than the skip limit</li>
	</ul>
	Db skip list can be changed with the property <code>CMopenDatabases.skipDbsInGraphs=db1ToSkip, db2ToSkip...</code><br>
	Db size limit can be changed with the property <code>CMopenDatabases.skipDbsWithSizeLtInGraphs=#mb</code><br>
	In the file '<code>$HOME/.asetune/asetune.user.properties</code>'.<br>
	The default skip list is: <code>master, model, pubs2, sybmgmtdb, sybpcidb, sybsecurity, sybsystemdb, sybsystemprocs</code><br>
	The default size limit is: <code>300</code><br>
	If you <b>always</b> want a database present in the graphs, add database to property <code>CMopenDatabases.keepDbsInGraphs=db1, db2...</code><br>
	Note: string in the "skip/keep" lists is java regex patterns.<br>
	New Table Background colors:
	<ul>
	    <li>BLUE - A Database backup is in progress</li>
	    <li>PINK - The transaction log for this database is filled to 90%, and will probably soon be full.</li>
	    <li>RED  - The transaction log for this database is <b>full</b> and users are probably suspended.</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Upgraded some of the third party libraries/jars</b><br>
	<ul>
	  <li>To version 4.0, Component: MIGLayout</li>
	  <li>To version 1.3.159, Component: H2 database</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: Added ASE configuration to dialog 'Configure ASE for Monitoring'</b><br>
	'capture missing statistics', 'enable metrics capture',
	'metrics elap max', 'metrics exec max', 'metrics lio max', and 'metrics pio max' in the
	dialog 'Configure ASE for Monitoring'. <br>
	Also moved this dialog to the 'tools' menu instead of 'view'.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Add: in tab "Objects" added some columns.</b><br>
	Note: this is only done if we connect to ASE CE of version 15.5 ESD#1 or above<br>
	Added columns: <code>MaxPhysicalLockWaitTime, MaxTransferReqWaitTime, MaxServiceTime,
		AvgQueueWaitTime, MaxQueueWaitTime, MaxTimeWaitedOnLocalUsers, MaxTransferSendWaitTime,
		MaxIOServiceTime, MaxDowngradeServiceTime</code> <br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	New: in log4j window</b><br>
	a checkbox if the window should be opened on errors, or simply stay in background
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changed behavior: for all CM's</b><br>
	Now <b>discarding</b> all ASE Messages with number 0, which probably is a 'print message'<br>
	If this is not the behavior you want this can be changed from the config file, using:<br>
	<samp>
	<i>shortCmName</i>.discardMsgZero=<b>true</b>|false<br>
	<i>shortCmName</i>.discardMsgZeroPrintInfo=<b>true</b>|false
	</samp>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changed behavior: for all CM's</b><br>
	Now <b>discarding</b> all ASE Messages that has to do with "in recovery" or "LOAD DATABASE"<br>
	When databases where undergoing "LOAD DATABASE", some CM's failed with messages complaining complaining about database is offline or in recovery...<br>
	Also the 'get ASE configuration' when connecting, complained about the same thing...<br>
	If this is not the behavior you want this can be changed from the config file, using:<br>
	<samp>
	<i>shortCmName</i>.discardMsgLoadDb=<b>true</b>|false<br>
	<i>shortCmName</i>.discardMsgLoadDbPrintInfo=<b>true</b>|false
	</samp>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changed behavior: Tooltip in JTable of Performance Counters are now focusable</b><br>
	By pressing F2 or by clicking in the text window.
	This means that you can now copy text from some tooltip windows. Especially good for Active Statements,
	so you can copy the showplan and SQL statements directly.<br>
	Also moved tooltip text from the JTable to be located on the "GUI tab" headers tooltip instead<br>
	The tooltip "describing highlighted rows" in the JTable was simply disturbing and was hiding the performance counters.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changed behavior: Tools-&gt;SQL Query Window </b><br>
	<ul>
	  <li>Added Syntax Highlight to the query text.</li>
	  <li>Simple code completion for some basic commands where added. (Ctrl+Space)</li>
	  <li>
		Show "what" SQL statement you are executing in a pop-up.<br>
		The pop-up will disappear when first result set arrives.<br>
	    This makes it easier to see what is happening when executing statements via pop-up
	    menu ("right click") on JTables, for example some commands does take a substantial time,
	    then we want to know what has been sent to the server.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changed behavior: Tools-&gt;Capture SQL </b><br>
	If config "plan text pipe active" wasn't enabled, a message window was displayed asking you to reconfigure.
	Now: This reconfigure message will only appear if you have selected the checkbox 'Sample showplan text'.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: Open an empty offline database gives strange error messages.</b><br>
	When connecting to an offline database, I simply check if some AseMon system tables exists,
	if they do not exists, inform user about this and stay in the Connection Dialog.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: The wizard 'Create Offline Session' wrote the wrong user/password in the props file.</b><br>
	And the PersistWriter class picked up the wrong password if it was encrypted.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: The wizard 'Create Offline Session', created empty ssh information to the offline file.</b><br>
	This was done even if none was necessary, which broke no-gui mode in some cases.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: The RepAgent collector, used a ASE 15.x syntax, which made ASE 11.5.4.x to break.</b><br>
	Solution: simply removing the optional text in: 'fetch [next from] cursor_name into @var'
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: PersistWriter</b><br>
	When a Performance Collector had no rows in it and had a Graph connected to it, we still tried to store the data, which cased some SQL syntax errors.<br>
	This was typically for a User Defined Collector, which grabbed info from a empty "trace" table.
	Solution: simply don't store Graph data with no rows in them.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: for CMactiveStatements, adding dependant role 'sybase_ts_role'</b><br>
	Also connect layer: if the user has 'sa_role' role, trying to grant 'sybase_ts_role' automatically.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: GetCounters thread, when checking for full transaction log in master database.</b><br>
	New rule for when truncate the transaction log in master. Only if 'capture missing statistics'
	is enabled and number of free pages is less than 50 (100K in a 2K page server).
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: Summary Panel, Ordering of graphs.</b><br>
	In some circumstances, after reordering the graphs, we were not able to enable them again. This is fixed now.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: Connection Dialog.</b><br>
	If 'enable monitoring' is not set, a re-config dialog will be displayed.<br>
	If the re-config was successfully, then continue with the login.<br>
	Previously you had to click on a bunch of windows, then "connect" again, but this is now removed.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: User Defined Counter.</b><br>
	The wizard wrote 'sqlOpen' in the properties file, now writes 'sqlInit'.<br>
	Is some cases the 'sqlInit' were done several times, or none.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: Persistent Counter Store.</b><br>
	Storing AseTuen Configuration was broken.<br>
	Now saving 'system.config', 'user.config', 'temp.config' and 'system.properties'.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: Performance Counter Properties Dialog</b><br>
	Now works a bit better on the templates, but I need to do more here.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: Graph 'Number of disk operations per second'.</b><br>
	The labels did not represent the correct counter, so wrong counter value was displayed for some of the labels.
	</LI>

	<b>Extended the check and save of ASE Configuration</b><br>
	Now sp_helpdb, sp_helpdevice, sp_helpserver and active traceflags are also stored in the
	Persistent Counter Storage<br>
	Trace flags also has a short explanation. The description are static and was extracted from ASE 15.5
	The values can be viewed from the main menu -&gt; View -&gt; View ASE Configuration...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Blocking Locks, Pop up</b><br>
	If there were "blocking locks" in the system or "full transaction logs", a dialog pops up and
	asked if you want to "move"	to that "tab". The decision was hard to reset...<br>
	I added a button in the concerned "tabs" so you	reset the "Move to tab" decision.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>"Offline Session Viewer" Dialog:</b><br>
	<ul>
	  <li>If you did "show" on a Timestamp and the parent SessionLevel had not been loaded, it will
	      automatically be loaded in the main window. This means it will load all the graphs for that
	      period and then position you at the Timestamp you did "show" on.</li>
	  <li>The right click menu on the <b>root</b> objects now has a menu item to check what version of
	      AseMon that was used to save the performance counters.</li>
	  <li>Option "Show Counter Info". If this is checked the TreeTable also shows what Performance
	      Counters that has been saved. A counter will display, which reflects how many records each
	      Performance Counter has. "---" means no records. <br>
	      At the day, hour and minute level a counter "summary" will display, this will tell you how
	      many records all the children levels has. <br>
	      Note: This will probably be redone, so I need feedback on how to solve this better.</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>"Connection Dialog", tab "Counter Storage" and "Offline Connect", button "..."</b><br>
	This button now opens the JFileChooser in same directory as the currently used database file.<br>
	When you choose a new database file. The old file will be replaced with the chosen one.<br>
	If any templates was currently selected, the JFileChooser will be opened in $ASEMON_SAVE_DIR
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Added some "internal" to the "Sample Information", which can be accessed via the tool tip</b><br>
	<ul>
	  <li>SQL Refresh Time - How long it took to execute the SQL statement to get Performance Counters</li>
	  <li>GUI Refresh Time - How long it took to refresh the GUI, including sorting the JTable</li>
	  <li>Local Calculation Time - Time spent in the method localCalculation() </li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>All tabs: Automatic Resize of Column Width, on/off</b><br>
	Previously all columns width was auto resized every now and then, in many cases this caused you'r
	eyes to flip around on the screen, which is some cases was a bit disturbing.<br>
	Now I'm saving the column width along with the column order, sort order etc. This means that we
	now can choose if we want the previous saved layout or do automatic resize of the column width.<br>
	<ul>
	  <li>In the right click menu in any Performance Counters JTable you can set what you want to do
	      for this table, the options are 'Use Global Settings' or 'Do Auto Adjustment'
	      or 'Use the saved column width'</li>
	  <li>In the MainMenu-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Auto Resize Column Width you can choose to 'Auto Adjustment' or not.</li>
	</ul>
	This is especially useful when viewing AseMon recordings (offline data)
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Tab: Active Statements</b><br>
	Tooltip help for HasMonSqlText and HasDbccSqlText was sometimes to wide, so now I try to format the
	text before showing it in the tooltip. This means, making line brakes if the output is to wide.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Tab: Statement Cache Details</b><br>
	Local Options to enable/disable 'SQL Text' and 'Showplan' results has been added.<br>
	This was introduced so we can disable it in the case those options took to much memory in AseMon
	or they where using to much resources on the ASE server side.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Tab: Objects</b><br>
	Added a column TabRowCount, which simply does row_count(DBID, ObjectID), if this is to heavy, it can be disabled with the property <code>CMobjActivity.TabRowCount=false</code>. <br>
	Note TabRowCount is only done in 15.0 or above<br>
	Took away all the cluster columns in 15.5, if we are not connected to a cluster ASE<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Tab: Spinlock Sum</b><br>
	Added records to track individual spinlocks on Data Caches (each CACHLET is now calculated)<br>
	Added records to track individual spinlocks on Engine RunQueue (type=KERNEL-INST)<br>
	Also a column 'type' was added, which contains: CACHE, CACHLET, DBTABLE, RESOURCE, KERNEL, KERNEL-INST, OTHER<br>
	Let me know if it takes more resources than previously.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New Dialog: Change 'Graph' Order and Visibility</b><br>
	In this one you can change the order of the graphs in the Trend Graphs Dashboard<br>
	The dialog can be reached from main menu: View -&gt; Change 'Graph' Order and Visibility
	and from right click on any of the graphs.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changes to graph enable/disable</b><br>
	Previously enable/disable of graphs could only be done from the Main Menu-&gt;View-&gt;Active Graphs<br>
	Now you can right click on any of the graphs, and in the "AseMon Menu" you have options to enable and disable graphs.<br>
	In any of the Performance Counter Tabs, in the Options Panel, top right, there is now a "graph" button.
	If the button is visible this Tab <b>has</b> Graphs attached. By clicking on the button, you can enable
	or disable the graphs attached to this Performance Counter Tab.
	Also in the "Summary" panel you have the Graph Button, right beside the label "Summary Panel",
	Click it to enable or disable graphs attached to the Summary Fields.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Added one field to the Summary panel, 'Full Transaction Logs'.</b><br>
	When there are databases that has full Transaction Logs, a red icon in the status bar shows up,
	telling you how many databases that has full transaction logs.<br>
	If you press the icon, you will jump to the 'Databases' tab.<br>
	In Databases Tab, databases with full transaction logs will be marked with a red background.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: offline connect</b><br>
	If you connected to a "offline database" to view sampled performance counters,
	then you couldn't disconnect and connect to a new "offline database" without restarting the GUI.<br>
	This is now fixed. Some additional cleaning up could be done like: clearing the GUI, but then latest
	graphs that were loaded will also be cleared. So lets wait with the "full clean" a bit...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>nogui mode:</b><br>
	Added <code>-f | --finish</code> switch, which shutdown or stop the no-gui service after # hours<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>nogui mode:</b><br>
	Changed <code>-d | --dbname</code> switch, which specifies the offline URL string.<br>
	<code>-d|--dbname</code> Now accepts variables <code>${DATE}, ${SERVERNAME}, ${ASEHOSTNAME}, ${ASEMON_HOME}, ${ASEMON_SAVE_DIR}</code><br>
	<br>
	Explanation of the above variables<br>
		<ul>
		<li><code>${DATE[:format=fmt[;roll=true|false]]}</code><br>
		The DATE will be substituted with a timestamp, the format of the timestamp is specified by modifier 'format'.<br>
		<br>
		The DATE variable has modifiers, which means you can change the behaviour of the variable.<br>
		<ul>
			<li>modifier: "<code>format=formatSpecification</code>" Is how the DATE string should be built. the specification is according to <code>java.text.SimpleDateFormat</code>, and the default value is <code>yyyy-MM-dd</code></li>
			<li>modifier: "<code>roll=true|false</code>"            This means: start/create a new database if we roll over into a new DATE string. with format=<code>yyyy-MM-dd</code> a new DB will be created every midnight, with format=<code>yyyy-MM-dd_HH</code> a new DB will be created every hour. The default value for <code>roll</code> is <code>false</code>. </li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		The default value for <code>format</code> can be changed with in the Configuration file with property <code>PersistWriterJdbc.h2DateParseFormat=formatString</code> <br>
		The default value for <code>roll</code>   can be changed with in the Configuration file with property <code>PersistWriterJdbc.h2NewDbOnDateChange=true|false</code> <br>
			</li>
		<li><code>${SERVERNAME} </code> <br>
		The SERVERNAME will be substituted with the content of the ASE global variable <code>@@servername</code> of which ASE server we are monitoring.<br>
			</li>
		<li><code>${ASEHOSTNAME}</code> <br>
		The ASEHOSTNAME will be substituted with the output from ASE function <code>asehostname()</code> of which ASE server we are monitoring.<br>
			</li>
		<li><code>${ASEMON_HOME}</code> <br>
		The ASEMON_HOME will be substituted with the installation path of AseMon.<br>
			</li>
		<li><code>${ASEMON_SAVE_DIR}</code> <br>
		The ASEMON_SAVE_DIR will be substituted with ${ASEMON_HOME}/data or whatever the environment variable is set to.<br>
			</li>
		</ul>
	Example:<br>
	<code>asemon -Usa -Pnull -SGORAN_1_DS -uxyz -ppasswd -shost1 -n all -i 30 -D H2 -d xxx.${ASEHOSTNAME}.${DATE:format=yyyy-MM-dd.HH;roll=true}</code><br>
	The above example, does:
	<ul>
		<li>Connects to ASE 'GORAN_1_DS' with user 'sa'      <br><code>-Usa -Pnull -SGORAN_1_DS</code></li>
		<li>Host monitoring on host 'host1' with user 'xyz'  <br><code>-uxyz -ppasswd -shost1</code></li>
		<li>Samples all Performance Counters                 <br><code>-n all</code></li>
		<li>Sample every 30 seconds                          <br><code>-i 30</code></li>
		<li>Use H2 as the database storage                   <br><code>-D H2</code></li>
		<li>H2 dbname would be 'xxx.host1.2011-05-04.19' in current path. Every hour a new database will be created.
	                                                         <br><code>-d xxx.${ASEHOSTNAME}.${DATE:format=yyyy-MM-dd.HH;roll=true}</code></li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Variables in URL</b><br>
	The variables <code>${DATE}, ${SERVERNAME}, ${ASEHOSTNAME}, ${ASEMON_HOME}, ${ASEMON_SAVE_DIR}</code>
	also works in the Connection Dialog in the "Counter Storage" tab.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changed the name of the error log.</b><br>
	For GUI mode: still ~/.asemon.AseMon.log<br>
	For NO-GUI mode: ~/.asemon.AseMon.nogui.log<br>
	Previously when running GUI and NO-GUI mode on same machine, they shared the error log.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>nogui mode:</b><br>
	if you are using ASE to store the performance counters, then use DYNAMIC_PREPARE
	and do 'set statement_cache off', this for performance reasons.<br>
	NOTE: this is only done by specifying -D and -d switches for the moment.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>"offline-read" mode</b><br>
	In "offline-read" mode, the "Offline Session Viewer" dialog checks for new Samples, which could arrive in the background.
	A Watermark in the dialog will tell you how many new samples that has been stored since last "refresh".
	Background storage of Performance Counters could for example be performed by the "no-gui" process if anyone has started that module.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>nogui mode:</b><br>
	Added <code>-r | --reconfigure</code> switch<br>
	This means that even if some ASE configuration options is not set, then configure them automatically. <br>
	Configuration names and there defaults is presented below.<br>
	It's only configuration options with a equal sign after, which automatically can be reconfigured.<br>

	<b>Basic Operating System Monitoring capabilities</b><br>
	Three new Tabs has been created for this:<br>
		<ul>
		<li><code>OS Disk Stat  </code> which uses iostat or vmstat to get OS disk statistics</li>
		<li><code>OS CPU(vmstat)</code> which uses vmstat to get OS overall OS statistics</li>
		<li><code>OS CPU(mpstat)</code> which uses mpstat to get OS statistics per CPU</li>
		</ul>
	The 'Operating System Monitoring' subsystem is using a SSH (Secure Shell) connection to remote host.
	In that SSH connection we can kick of the various OS Commands and receive the output (see below for more details)<br>
	<br>
	Below is a breath description of the subsystem<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
			What is this Basic Operating System Monitoring.<br>
			If you want to monitor the Operating System with some basic command, this is one way you can do it.<br>
			And also if you are storing the Performance Counters in a Persistent storage, the OS Monitoring is in sync with <br>
			the Performance Counters from the monitored ASE Server, which makes it easier to correlate the various metrics.
			</li>

			<li>
			What OS Monitoring Commands are supported for the moment.<br>
			The basic command which for the moment is supported is:
			<ul>
			  <li> <code> iostat </code></li>
			  <li> <code> vmstat </code></li>
			  <li> <code> mpstat </code></li>
			</ul>
			If you are using <b>Veritas</b> as the Disk IO subsystem and want to sample disk statistics with <b>vxstat</b> and not iostat.<br>
			Make sure <b>vxstat</b> is executable and in the <b>$PATH</b> off the user that you're connecting to the Operating System with.<br>
			Then it will execute <b>vxstat</b> instead of iostat and use that information.
			</li>

			<li>
			But every Operating System work slightly different.<br>
			But all Operating Systems has different layouts for the various commands. <br>
			For Example 'iostat' does not produce the same output on Solaris as it does on Linux. <br>
			<br>
			When a connection to the OS made, It will try to identify what OS were connecting to (by using uname -a) and then use OS specific parsers. <br>
			This implies that a \"parser\" is implement for every OS.<br>
			So if you are getting errors, faulty output or that your OS is not supported, please notify me and I will try to fix it.<br>
			Also if you want to change the parameters/flags to the OS Commands, to get better Performance Counters, kick me and I'll fix it!<br>
			<br>
			The only thing that can change by ourself is the OS Commands sleep interval<br>
			This is done by adding the below information to the configuration file. (asemon.properties)"
			<ul>
			  <li> for iostat: <code>MonitorIoSolaris.sleep=5</code></li>
			  <li> for mpstat: <code>MonitorVmstatAix.sleep=5</code></li>
			  <li> for vmstat: <code>MonitorMpstatLinux.sleep=5</code></li>
			</ul>
			You can probably fill in the blanks... <code>[Monitor][Subsystem][Osname].sleep=[samplePeriodToTheCommand]</code><br>
			<br>
			If you need to debug or check what the OS Command is sending, you can add the following to the Configuration file:<br>
			<code>log4j.logger.asemon.hostmon.HostMonitor=DEBUG</code><br>
			<br>
			Or you can use the 'log viewer' to change the 'log level' while AseMon is still running: <br>
			MainMenu-&gt;View-&gt;Open Log Window..., then Press 'Set log level'... locate asemon.hostmon.HostMonitor and change it.
			</li>

			<li>
			The big picture of how it's implememted.<br>
			The way it's implemented:<br>
			<ul>
			  <li> Start a background task that executes for instance 'iostat' every 2 seconds (iostat -xdz 2) or whatever sample period (see section above).</li>
			  <li> Parse the output from the OS Command and store it in a intermediate in-memory storage.</li>
			  <li> Then when AseMon think it's time to sample some Performance Counters (depends on AseMon's sample time)<br>
			       The subsystem does an <b>average</b> calculation on the intermediate stored values and then resets the intermidiate storage so that new samples from the OS Command can be sampled. <br>
			  <li> Now the Performance Counters or values are available to view in AseMon.</li>
			</ul>
			For 'vmstat' I choose a slightly different approach, this since 'vmstat' is only delivering one row per vmstats-sample period. <br>
			So in this case I do <b>not</b> do a summary or average calculation.<br>
			<br>
			Instead I simply displays <b>all</b> the sampled records I have received from the command with a 'timestamp' column to indicate when it was received.<br>
			If you instead want to have some kind of average or summary, please notify me and explain...
			</li>

			<li>
			What to expect in upcomming releases of AseMon.<br>
			In current release there are limited support for User Defined OS Monitoring, which you can add to the Configuration file<br>
			In future release, the plan is to add a <b>Wizard</b> where you can add User Defined Host Monitor Counters and maybe support for diff/rate counters as well.<br>
			<br>
			With a Used Defined OS Monitoring you could for example Monitor Outputs from <b>your</b> Application Server or in whatever way you think is's usable.<br>

	<b>Added some command line options, -D for shortcut ASE/ASA PCS storage.</b><br>
	Also fixed some issues for PCS when storing data in ASE and ASA<br>
	Fixed the "check for new sample values", this is useful when: reading a Persistent Storage from
	the GUI, while at the same time someone (probably the no GUI mode) is applying data to it.

	<b>Restricted GUI mode when "time to live" has expired.</b><br>
	When "In Development Version" and "time to live" has expired, the GUI will still be able to start, but a very restricted
	environment is available. Only: Persistent Counter Storge - Read (offline read) will be available.<br>
	This 'start' option was implemented as a fail-safe mechanism, and should only be used if the new
	AseMon version is not capable of reading the old database. In 99.9% the new AseMon version will
	be able to read Performance Counters stored by a earlier AseMon release.

<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2011-01-12</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
	The work to port to Java Generics has been started...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Splash screen when starting.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Check for Java 6 version is done prior to starting asemon (in that bat/sh file)<br>
	This because in java 6, we are using the splash screen option, which is not available
	in earlier releases on java. If the version control is done later, then we will receive
	an error that the command line switch '-splash' is unknown...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	When switched to Java 1.6 and JXTable 1.6.2, the below started to happen:<br>
	When rows are deleted from a JTable, in some cases it used the "deleted" view row
	from the table to get cell values for rendering in some cases. <br>
	I don't know why this is happening, but it seems to happen in some repaint scenario
	when I have highlighters (in JXTable) + a bunch of more stuff...<br>
	A lot of the faults has been removed, but some are still left...<br>
	A ';' sign is printed to the standard output every time it happens. This just to notify
	me in the future, that the problem still exists...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: active statements<br>
	Added 2 columns 'HasMonSqlText' and 'MonSqlText', which does: <br>
	select SQLText from master..monProcessSQLText where SPID = &lt;SPID&gt;<br>
	This will show the current running SQL Statement, this will then also include
	SQL statements that has been executed via dynamic SQL inside a Stored procedure.
	exec('do SQL here'). In some cases/versions it's not showed by DBCC sqltext().<br>
	It will also help you to validate if the SQL statement is still running. Info from the
	monProcessSQLText only has rows if the statement is still running, while DBCC sqltext
	will show you the <b>last</b> executed SQL statement, which is still left in the PSS structure.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tabs: Process, Active Statements, Blocking<br>
	On SPID's that are blocked: Changed default color to PINK (almost read)
	</LI>

	<LI>
	In Memory History: the history time can now be set lower than the Graph History<br>
	A Spinner on the right of "Graph History in Minutes" is now available...<br>
	To access the "in memory history", press the "DB magnifyingGlass" icon on the toolbar.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Cell renders has been changed to format numbers in a better way.<br>
	Spaces between "large" numbers for readability.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Multiple column sorts can now be done (current implementation supports 3 columns).<br>
	The column header, has a indicator that tells you if the sort is done Ascending, Descending or Unsorted.
	The indicator also tells you if this column is the first, second or third column in the sort.<br>
	Initial Sort order (first click) has also been changed to Descending, so that high numbers is at top, because this is what we normally want to sort at.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Storing and Restoring of JTable Column Order, Visibility and Sort Order now works better.<br>
	Especially when viewing offline and in-memory data.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Now also storing/restoring the filter panel on asemon restarts.<br>
	Also applying the filters when changing between	different data samples in the offline mode.
	also works when changing between InMemory view and Regular Online view.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Active Statements<br>
	Previously the MultiSampled flag was raised when the SPID was present between two samples.<br>
	Now that check also includes in the StartTime for the statement is the same.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	ASE Configuration (both sp_configure, sp_helpcache and sp_cacheconfig) are stored in the
	Persistent Counter Storage (a offline database) when asemon starts.<br>
	The configuration can be viewed from the GUI when reading the offline database.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	New Tab: Procedure Call Stack<br>
	This will show the nesting level of how the procs/triggers/views are executed.<br>
	This could be used as a small profiler, to check what procedure stack is currently executing,
	but to make it into a better profiler this needs to be sampled *often*, which might not be a good idea...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	New graphs:<br>
	<UL type="circle">
	<LI>CPU Summary using global variables @@cpu_busy, @@cpu_io (depends on tab 'Summary')</LI>
	<LI>Number of transactions (only in ASE 15.0.3 ESD#1 and higher) (depends on tab 'Summary')</LI>
	<LI>Number of Connections/users that are connected to the ASE (depends on tab 'Summary')</LI>
	<LI>Disk read/write per second using global variables @@total_read, @@total_write (depends on tab 'Summary')</LI>
	<LI>Network Packet read/sent per second using global variables @@pack_recv, @@pack_sent (depends on tab 'Summary')</LI>
	<LI>Checkpoint and Housekeeper Writes per second (depends on tab 'Processes')</LI>
	<LI>Number of Procedure Requests per Second (depends on tab 'Procedure Cache')</LI>
	</UL>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Engines<br>
	in ASE 15.5 the column 'IO CPU Time' was added to the monEngine table... <br>
	Start to use that one, otherwise the percentage calculation will be wrong.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Number of tabs has started to be a factor... it becomes harder to navigate between them.<br>
	So now you can hide tabs that you are not using, or simply reorder the tabs to suit your usage of asemon.<br>
	Right click on any tab, and choose 'Tab Options', in here you can personalize the tabs a bit.<br>
	Or from the main menu: View -&gt; Change 'Tab Titles' Order and Visibility <br>
	The second thing that has been done on tab navigation is: on the toolbar two new buttons has
	been added where you can Activate (jump to) a specific tab. One button is in the original order,
	the second button is sorted on the tab title name.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	New Tab: sp_monitorconfig<br>
	This simply executes the procedure sp_monitorconfig, which could be handy to have<br>
	Recommendation is to have the 'postpone' field set to 600 (10 minutes or so), so we do not sample this that often.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Saving the active graphs in the Summary panel, did not work, fixed that...<br>
	So now after a restart I remember what graphs was active or disabled.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	File Location changes:<br>
	Temporary GUI save settings file (asemon.save.properties), "screen capture" files and log files
	directory has been moved from ($HOME) to ($HOME/.asemon)
	</LI>

	<LI>
	When the expire date for the in-development release a GUI pop up is showed.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Processes<br>
	The local option "Show System Processes" did not work on some ASE versions, this was fixed
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Active Objects: In some cases (for example "self joins"), the object/table was
	presented several times by the MDA tables, which caused this tab to fail.<br>
	This has been fixed in the following way: if several rows with the same PK is found,
	and we have a column that is named 'dupMergeCount', we simply merge the previous found
	row with the current one (simulate a sum()) and increment the column 'dupMergeCount',
	the last thing is done just to specify how many rows we actually merged into this row.<br>
	If 'dupMergeCount' is above 0, then we will have several rows summarized into this row.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Command line parameters: A couple of new ones has been introduced<br>
	For example: -U user -P passwd -S server -s sampleTime -d h2dbname <br>
	These switches is mainly for the --noGui option (override values in the noGui config file)<br>
	If you have not produced a noGui config file via the "offline wizard" you can now choose
	to specify --NoGui small|medium|large|all, which collects a predefined subset of
	Performance Counters into the Persistent Counter Storage.<br>
	If you want full control over what to collect, please use the "offline wizard" to specify
	what Performance Counters that should be collected.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Blocking<br>
	Fixed so that it can contain multiple PK (this since no difference calculations is done in this tab)
	</LI>

	<LI>
	The pop up dialog informing you about "out of memory" situations,
	now the OK button works to close the window
	</LI>

	<LI>
	The tooltip on column header does not work in offline mode.<br>
	The solution was to store the MDA help dictionary stuff in the offline database, and read
	it in again when connection to a offline database.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	In earlier releases the ESD level was reset to 0 or 1 when it was over 9<br>
	Now the max ESD level is keept at 9, so even if you running ESD#10 it will
	show as #9 in the internal integer holding ase version.<br>
	This will be redone in later some later release, using better granularity of the version number.<br>
	Also ESD number handling was changed in some release to support "sub ESD levels",
	so a @@version string can now look like (Adaptive Server Enterprise/12.5.4/EBF 15400 ESD#7.1/P/...) <br>
	The parsing for this does now work, but I do not keep track of the ESD sub level.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Cached Procedures<br>
	Now has a Icon, which tells you what type of object it is (rule, view, trigger or procedure)
	</LI>

	<LI>
	When asemon connect to ASE it puts the asemon version into the sysprocesses.host field
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Active Statements<br>
	new option: get procedure call stack, which also gets the procedure call stack from the table monProcessProcedures
	</LI>

	<LI>
	SQL Window Tool, add icon so it's visible in the "taskbar" in windows.<br>
	This makes it easier to navigate between many different SQL Windows...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	When in the in-memory view, the previous versions still updated the 'Summary' panel.<br>
	This is not done anymore.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	A Dummy/Demo test application has been made, so you can "simulate" workload towards an ASE Server
	and train yourself how to use asemon.<br>
	This is the file perfdemo.bat<br>
	To be able to use this you must install a test/demo database, see README.txt and DO_DEMO.txt in classes/asemon/perftest/sql for more information<br>
	My intention was not to release this application, I created it simply to do "dummy load"
	on the ASE server during a customer demo that I gave, but you might also be able to use it,
	please give me some feedback if it should be included in the package or if I should be deleted.<br>
	So the README.txt and DO_DEMO.txt files are just my internal notes...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Changed to Java 1.6, so I wont support JVM 1.5 anymore...<br>
	The change to 1.6 was needed for the new SwingX (JXTable etc) 1.6.2 (went from 1.0 to 1.6.2)<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	A first attempt to store column order and restore that order after restart.<br>
	This will most likely fuckup some other stuff where I don't convert viewToModel,
	but it's a first attempt...<br>
	Also storing the sort order and restores that.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Also added some 'restore column order' and some other stuff into the right click menu
	on Counter Model tables.

	<LI>
	A first attempt to save and load the filter (Column, Operation, Value, NoZeroCounters)
	</LI>

	<LI>
	When moving around using the arrows key on the keyboard on the in-memory and offline slider
	caused the system to update the view on every keystroke. This overloaded the system when holding
	down the arrow key. So I added timers of 100ms, which means that loading of data is done
	when no input has been given for 100ms.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Using proxy-vole (http://code.google.com/p/proxy-vole) as a automatic proxy resolver
	when checking updates or doing other http requests.<br>
	For example this means that if the client is using a proxy server when doing internet/web
	lookups, the client can now use the PAC file in IExplorer or Firefox to figgure out what
	proxy server to use. (PAC=Proxy Auto Config. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config)

	A bunch of bug fixes and improvements not listed here

	<LI>
	Tab: Processes<br>
	The choice to disable sampling of "system threads".<br>
	In ASE Cluster Edition, there are a bunch of system threads/SPID's, which could
	blur the vision in this tab.<br>
	For now; this was implemented using SQL, but in the future it might very well be
	a "filter" option instead. Then we would still benefit from the "Persistence Counter Storage"
	to store all threads in the database (if we were using that), but when later when viewing
	data we could filter them out in the GUI.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Query Window:<br>
	When doing "ctrl-c" to copy into the clipboard in some places the new-line was not copied.<br>
	A "copy" button was also implemented that takes "all" the objects in the result set output
	and put it into the clipboard, JTables are coped into ASCII tables.
	keys: F5, F9 are now shortcuts to execute SQL, this to emulate dbisql<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	You can now Pause all data collection by pressing the 'Pause icon' on the tool bar or
	the 'Pause Icon' in the status field. To resume data collection, just press the same icon gain,
	which now will have a 'Play icon'.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Added dbcc pss(0, ${SPID}, 2) on the right click in all tables.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Engines<br>
	Only select records from monEngines with the Status 'online'.<br>
	Also a new column 'IOCPUTime' was added if you're above ASE 15.5 and 15.0.3 CE<br>
	NOTE: it's currently not part of the percentage calculation.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	For ASE Cluster Edition, remember the system_view settings (cluster or instance)<br>
	The system view can be changed in the 'Summary' tab if you are connected to a ASE CE.

	<LI>
	Login dialog: when pressing enter in the password field and all the mandatory fields are filled in
	a login is attempted (same as pressing OK button).

	Screen shots can now be made from a button on the tool bar, using the "Camera icon".<br>
	It will produce a JPG file in the "home" directory.

	<LI>
	Tab: Objects when we are in 15.5 and 15.0.3 CE, I have added a bunch of new columns, mainly for
	Cluster Edition measurements...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	In the 'Summary' tab I also grabs @@connections and an 15.5 or 15.0.3 CE I also get Transactions

	If you're running out of memory, I will try to clear all in memory history and do
	Garbage Collection. After the GC hopefully enough memory will be available to continue.<br>
	TODO: I show a blocking message, this needs to changed into a non blocking message.

	An all tabs: a User Defined SQL statement for tool tip on cell content can be added<br>
	This is done in the config file, example:<br>
	table.tooltip.SPID=select * from sysprocesses where spid = ?<br>
	table.tooltip.CMprocActivity.SPID=select suser_name(suid) from sysprocesses where spid = ?<br>
	The first config would execute SQL and show the result set as a tool tip in all tab's<br>
	The second will override the default when you are in tab 'CMprocActivity'.<br>
	For SPID there is a default tool tip that shows some info from monProcess
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Active Statements<br>
	A spid that holds blocking locks, may not always be visible in monProcessStatement<br>
	For example id you in isql do 'begin tran; insert into t1 values(1); go', the spid will
	be in status 'waiting for incoming network data' and not really active.<br>
	There for I introduced two set of rows 'ACTIVE' and 'BLOCKER', the 'ACTIVE' originates from
	monProcessStatement, while 'BLOCKERS' are spid's that blocks others from working. Both the
	'ACTIVE' and the 'BLOCKER' can be visible in the table.<br>
	Also added 'dbcc stacktrace' of all spid's visible in this table<br>
	The ability to disable 'showplan', 'sqltext' and 'stacktrace' can be done from the GUI
	and is written to the user settings temporary property file as
	'CMActiveStatements.sample.showplan=false, CMActiveStatements.sample.dbccSqltext=false, CMActiveStatements.sample.dbccSqltext=false'.<br>
	Also added column 'BlockingOtherSpids' which is a list of spid's that the current spid is blocking,
	and by the way, rows/spid's that blocks other will be marked with the color red.

	Name can now only be a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and not starting with CM.

	Added 'needRole' to CounterModel and UserDefinedCounterModel, which will be checked
	just as 'needConfig' and show errors on the 'tab' if you are not authorized to view
	the 'tab'.<br>

	Better support for command line switches. This is now done in java instead of
	the bat or shell script that starts asemon.

	Also multiple host:port are fetched from the sql.ini/interfaces file and can also be
	typed in manually. However jConnect doesn't seem to like it...<br>
	If the information which is
	you can switch to use the "raw" URL mode instead, check the 'Use URL' check box, then
	the URL text field will be used when connection. By pressing &lt;enter&gt; in the field the
	URL text will be parsed and transferred to the above disabled fields.

	Some extra information is also displayed in the 'Summary' tab. In this panel you can also
	choose if you want to view counters for the whole cluster or just the instance which
	asemon is connected to.<br>
	Specific Counter Tab's will probably added later on, but for now create you'r own Cluster
	Specific counters using the wizard 'create User Defined Counter', please send you'r best
	Cluster Edition Counters to me so I can implement them for everyone.

	Added Counter tab 'Sysmon Raw' which works in peer with 'Spinlock Sum'.<br>
	This counter is in extreme first version, and just reads the values that was left over
	from the 'Spinlock Sum' counter tab. No enrichment of the data has be done so far, so
	it's just the "raw" counters that the sp_sysmon is using.<br>
	In the future a sp_sysmon look alike can be done (lets use a JXTreeTable for that).

	Implemented "offline" reader<br>
	This means that we now can read data from a database into the GUI, the data has previously
	been stored by asemon into that database (Persistent Counter Storage).<br>
	The sampled data could have been stored by the "non gui" mode or by the GUI itself,
	and viewed at a later time.<br>
	This functionality also enables us to have <b>one</b> "no gui" asemon that stores the data
	in the Persistent Counter Storage and <b>many</b> asemon GUI's that views the data.<br>
	That is if several dba's wants to view the same data without having several asemon GUI's
	that each individually issues SQL statements to collect data.<br>
	Please I need feedback on how this is working...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	A green "line/stripe" at the right hand side of the tab on the TabbedPane, which
	indicates that there are sampled data under that tab.<br>
	This needs rework, because it overwrites menu items, tool tip and other components
	that are displayed on top of the "stripe" indicator.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	In the Persistent Counter Storage, you can now choose if you want to store <b>all</b>
	data or just some of them, you can choose to store Absolute, Diff or Rate Counters in
	the data store.<br>
	There are check boxes for this in each counter panel and also in the Wizard that creates
	an file for the off line storage.

	<LI>
	If we loose the database connection to the monitored server in GUI mode, it tries to
	automatically reconnect if the option is set in the Connection dialog.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Menu-&gt;view-&gt;Set Counter Set Parameters<br>
	Is a new Dialog where you can change most of the options that is normally located

	to change some option under <b>all</b> the various tabs.

	The graphs are now zoomable. Just drag the mouse over the are you want to zoom in on.

	<LI>
		two new tabs 'System Load' and 'Temp Db'<br>
		'System Load' needs ASE 15.5 or higher and shows information from the monSysLoad, which can help you

		Sometimes that graphs did not get updated in the summary panel.
		This was a timing problem, when data is captured, it's done with
		it's own thread. If the "get data" thread was not complete before
		we wanted to update the graphs, the graphs was not updated.
		So now I wait for the "get data thread" to complete before continue.

	<LI>
		The Toolbar was added.
	</LI>

	<LI>
		The first glans at "offline setup wizard" was created (need more work here)

		Changed the j4log from 1.2.8 -&gt; 1.2.15
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Some small stuff as well

		Fixed bug in summary panel counte. If ASE listens to several networks
		only show the first "min()" listener. otherwise the subquery will fail...
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Added Wrap/Scroll capability in the TabPanel

		Fixed bug in engine average calculation...
		in version X i changed getRateValueAvg to discard 0.0 as "rows"
		this was to support the Average Service Time in DeviceIO graph better.
		But now I'm using getRateValueAvgGtZero instead.
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Added the "WATER MARK" text to TabularControlPanel and SummaryPanel
		to easier know what is happening behind the scenes... are we connected...
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Added some descriptions for Tooltip on the TABS.
	</LI>

	<LI>
		added methods: isMonConnected(), getMonConnection() this will hopefully
		be used to distinguish between OFF-Line mode and ON-Line mode.

		Added this "version history" comment
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Doing "late initialization" of CountersObject, which means that
		we can create the GUI graphics and decide later what SQL statement to
		use dependent on what version the ASE Server is of.
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Took away a lot of static variables in GetCounters and MainFrame
	</LI>
</UL>

		Major thing is NO-GUI mode is configurable and can persist the
		counters in a JDBC session. (ASE and H2 has been tested)
		H2 would be the preferred option. This so we can store the
		counters in another server/database store than the one we
		pulling out data from. Using the H2 DB it would also be
		easier to sample ASE counters on Unix systems and later on
		view them on a Windows machine.
	</LI>

	<LI>
		some changes to "capture SQL" tool.
	</LI>

	<LI>
		saving more options in the "save props" file!
	</LI>

	<LI>
		And a lot more small things.
