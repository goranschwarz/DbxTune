<H1>History of what has been done so far</H1>

<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2012-xx-xx</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
	<b>New: in tab the 'Waits', graph(s) on the right hand side (local Graph)</b><br>
	You can view 'WaitTime' and/or number of 'Waits' by the individual Events, or as a summary at the Wait Event Class<br> 
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: in the tab 'Devices', graph(s) on the right hand side (local Graph)</b><br>
	You can view 'TotalIOs', 'Reads', 'APFReads' and 'Writes' in different graphs.<br>
	The distribution in the graphs are by Logical Device Name<br> 
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: in the tab 'IOSum', graph(s) on the right hand side (local Graph)</b><br>
	You can view 'IOs', 'IOTime', 'AvgServ_ms' in different graphs.<br> 
	The distribution in the graphs are by 'IOType' (User Data, User Log, Tempdb Data, Tempdb log, System)<br> 
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: in the tab 'Procedure Cache Module Usage', graph(s) on the right hand side (local Graph)</b><br>
	You can view Active Memory Usage, by ModuleName<br> 
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: in the tab 'Procedure Cache Memory Usage', graph(s) on the right hand side (local Graph)</b><br>
	You can view Active Memory Usage, with one Summary Graph, or one graph for each 'ModuleName'<br> 
	The distribution in the graphs are by 'AllocatorName'<br> 
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: users does not require 'mon_role' and 'enable monitoring' anymore</b><br>
	If a user logs in without 'mon_role' or if 'enable monitoring' is not enabled, AseTune
	will still allow the user to login.<br>
	But the environment will be <b>restricted</b>. Number of available Performance Counters will
	of course be very limited. The Summary panel will still be maintained, in there you have
	access to ASE Servers global variables for CPU, Disk and Network. Graphs connected to the 
	summary fields will automatically be enabled.<br> 
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: Column in in tab 'Cached Objects'</b><br>
	<ul>
	   <li><code>ProcessesAccessing</code> - Number of processes currently accessing the object</li>
	   <li><code>TotalSizeKBDiff   </code> - <code>TotalSizeKB</code> as diff calculated from previous sample</li>
	   <li><code>CachedKBDiff      </code> - <code>CachedKB</code> as diff calculated from previous sample</li>
	   <li><code>TableCachedPct    </code> - How much of this table is kept in the cache. <b>Formula</b>: <code>CachedKB/TotalSizeKB * 100</code></li>
	   <li><code>CacheID           </code> - Just the ID of the cache</li>
	   <li><code>TotalCacheSizeKB  </code> - The size of the data cache where this table is residing</li>
	   <li><code>CacheUsagePct     </code> - How much space does this table use of the whole cache. <b>Formula</b>: <code>CachedKB/TotalCacheSizeKB * 100</code></li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhancement: When you get a out-of-memory pop up.</b><br>
	When you get a out-of-memory, I previously just purged the in-memory history<br>
	In addition I also now lower the in-memory history size to 1 minute<br> 
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: Disable Monitoring on disconnect or exit.</b><br>
	In the "ASE Monitor Configuration" panel you can choose to "disable monitoring", "prompt" on exit.<br>
	This has been extended to "on exit or disconnect", so new when this option has been enabled,
	a dialog is displayed when you disconnect from a ASE (or it simply disables monitoring).<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: Dialog "Configure ASE for Monitoring", Disable Monitoring.</b><br>
	If you have <b>disabled</b> monitoring using the Dialog "Configure ASE for Monitoring", 
	then monitoring can not continue, so lets simply do disconnect... <br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: Connection Dialog, choosing a sql.ini/interfaces file.</b><br>
	Sometimes the old sql.ini/interfaces file was loaded, this is better now.<br>
	Also if you choose a new sql.ini/interfaces file, and it not in the correct format
	a question will pop up, to ask if you want to edit the file.<br>   
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: When ASE is in shutdown mode, put data collection on hold.</b><br>
	Previously all sorts of error messages was thrown, when ASE was in shutdown mode<br>
	Not it says 'ASE Shutdown in progress' in the watermark and data collection is simply
	put on hold until the ASE goes down. And if reconnect is enabled, it will then wait for
	the ASE restart to complete and connect again.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: Code completion in the SQL Window tool.</b><br>
	Fixed some issues here, and also added some more static completions.<br>
	The code completion initialization, can now be canceled.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: All Performance Counters, restore selected row after refresh.</b><br>
	Restore of selected row in the table did not work as supposed.<br>
	Now it tries to restore current selected table row by using the primary key, if it can't
	use the primary key, it will try to fall back to last selected model row.<br>
	</LI>

</UL>


<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2012-01-05</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
	<b>New Functionality: ASE Application Tracing</b><br>
	A new tool 'ASE Application Tracing', for details see http://www.sybase.com/files/White_Papers/ASE15-apptrace-070507-wp.pdf
	for more information how this works.<br>
	This is just a GUI on top of ASE 'set tracefile ...' functionality.<br>
	The add on for the GUI is that it can work with remote files, so you can start the trace on your 
	local client (probably a PC), tehn if the ASE is located on a Unix/Linux host an Secure Shell SSH connection
	will be opened to do tail of the trace file. This makes it <b>much</b> easier to view the trace file.<br>
	Also current executed stored procedures etc will be fetch and displayed in the local interface<br>
	This is a really usefull tool if you want to trace what a specific SPID is doing in the server.<br>
	<b>Note:</b> This uses a lot of memory in the GUI... lets see if we can fix that in any future release.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: Performance Counter Properties Dialog.</b><br>
	When you right click on the JTabbedPane, you can choose Properties.<br>
	This Dialog was previously a Simple HTML based Dialog.<br>
	Now it's Swing based components with following functionality<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Check generated SQL, even if the Performance Counter is <b>not</b> initialized.</li>
		<li>Simulate other ASE Versions: check what SQL will be generated for another ASE release, and in ASE Cluster Edition</li>
		<li>Syntax highlighted SQL area</li>
		<li>Color highlights in SQL area for PrimaryKey, Difference and Percent columns</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changed behavior: Connecting to different ASE Version, no need to restart AseTune</b><br>
	It's now supported to connect to ASE Version X, then disconnect and connect to another ASE Version<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: SQL Code Completion in SQL Window tool</b><br>
	Using Ctrl+Space you bring up SQL Code Completion, for table names and columns<br>
	For the moment I don't use a parser to check where in the SQL code you are, so for the moment
	it's kind off basic... Column completion work works in a limited way for table aliases.<br>
	Please report strange behavior...<br> 
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: DDL storage functionality</b><br>
	In some of the performance counters, get top 10, or all rows (DBName, ObjectName) and get various
	information from the ASE Server (sp_help/procText, sp__optdiag, sp_depends) on tables/procedures<br>
	If the table or procedure has dependencies to other tables/procedures, add q DDL request of those objects as well.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: Connection Dialog, PCS: now show DDL Lookup/Storage properties</b><br>
	When recording a session you can now choose to do "DDL Lookup" and save it to the Persistent Counter Store<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: View DDL </b><br>
	The entries stored be the 'DDL storage functionality' can be viewed in a TreeTable,<br>
	Access the 'View DDL' from:
	<ul>
		<li>MainMenu -&gt; Tools -&gt; DDL Viewer</li>
		<li>Any Performance Counter: Right click menu -&gt; DDL Viewer</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Note:</b> For the moment 'DDL View' is only available in "offline" mode. In the future this 
	could also be implemented for "online" access.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: Performance Counter 'SPID Waits'</b><br>
	Use this to track wait time for individual SPID's, There will be approximate 5-10 rows per SPID. 
	So there could be quite a bunch of rows in this one...<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New functionality in Tab: Databases</b><br>
	A local bar graph "Transaction Log Space Usage in Percent". Colors of the bars 
	(green = less than 80% usage, orange = between 80-90% usage, red = above 90% usage)<br>
	A Dialog has also been created to choose what databases should be part of both the local
	bar graph and the attached trend graphs. This is on the button "Set 'Graph' databases".<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New functionality in Tab: Sysmon Raw</b><br>
	Calculating some of the ordinary "sp_sysmon" calculation.<br>
	The goal is to present some kind of sp_sysmon report simulation in the "Extended Info Panel".<br>
	Maybe a TreeTable or similar will present the information, but a lot of work is still needed here.<br>
	For now: the information is printed as raw text, in the Extended Info Panel, which is located on the right hand side for the text report.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: Column in in 'Statement Cache Details'</b><br>
	In ASE 15.7, Show 'show_cached_plan_in_xml(SSQLID, 0)' in the details.<br>
	The information will be saved/displayed in raw XML format until a good reader is available.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: tab 'Objects': Column name 'ObjectName' was showing IndexName instead of table name</b><br>
	In AseTune Version 2011-09-30, 2.6.0: I changed to used <code>ObjectName</code> column instead of <code>ObjectName=object_name(...)</code><br>
	This was not so good since the "raw" <code>ObjectName</code> displayed the IndexName instead of table name, so <br>
	I changed it back to display the table name using <code>object_name(...)</code>, and also added a column (in ase 15.0.2 or higher)<br>
	that displays the IndexName. This will make it easier to filter and sort on table name.<br>
	</LI>
	
	<LI>
	<b>Change: tab 'Objects': Added some columns</b><br>
	<ul>
	    <li>NumUsedPages - which just does: <code>data_pages(A.DBID, A.ObjectID, A.IndexID)</code></li>
	    <li>RowsPerPage - which calculates number of rows per page</li>
	    <li>Remark - which tries to figure out what is happening of with this object. is it a table scan, etc...</li>
	</ul>
	The above columns will make it easier to check if many LogicalReads "ok", meaning is this on a small or large table<br>
	This can be disabled/enabled from the Local Options, in the 'Objects' tab.
	Or from any of the configuration files, using property 'CMobjectActivity.TabRowCount=true|false'<br>  
	<b>Note:</b>The column 'Remark' should be treaded as 'experimental', use tooltip on the cell to get more information about the remark.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: tab 'Proc Cache Memory Usage', now holds more values</b><br>
	Now we do outer join on monProcedureCacheModuleUsage *= monProcedureCacheMemoryUsage<br>
	This means that memory modules that does not have detailed sections, now is available by
	the 'head/main' section. For example Dynamic SQL, does NOT have any details, which made it
	a bit harder to read. But now these modules are also available in the details.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: Summary Panel, some negative counters to zero</b><br>
	In the summary panel, some counters that could turn negative are now reseted to zero<br>
	(Transactions, io_total_read, io_total_write, pack_received, pack_sent, packet_errors)<br>
	If the above counters goes negative trend graphs would be "unreadable"<br>
	while other columns should be able to turn negative like (Connections etc...)<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Add/Changes to: SQL Window, stand alone utility</b><br>
	When starting the SQL Window tool as an external java process, using sqlw.bat. A menu bar and
	a toolbar panel is created. This so you can connect/disconnect to ASE servers using the Connection Dialog.<br>
	The stand alone utility 'sqlw' is released in this drop.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: Tool: SQL/Query Window</b><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Now has a "cancel" button, when a statement is executing</li>
		<li>All ASE SQLExceptions are converted into SQLWarnings and printed along with the result sets.<br>
		    For non ASE connections (offline storage) will still throw SQLExceptions</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: Tool: Capture SQL</b><br>
	<ul>
		<li>New field to write "extra where clause, on active statements</li>
		<li>New field to write "order by, on active statements</li>
	</ul>
	If SQL error happens, the refresh will STOP and wait for you to fix any syntax errors in "where restrictions".<br>
	Last executed SQL statement can be viewed wit tooltip on the panel.<br>
	Note: This tool will be rewritten from scratch "soon"<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changed text in error message: Connection Dialog</b><br>
	Some users had problems connecting, simply due to a faulty password.<br>
	They just interpreted the "raw" JDBC error message in faulty way... It was to complicated<br>
	So I added extra text in case the main exception was 'JZ00L'.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: "Extended Info Panel" on all Performance Counter tabs.</b><br>
	The "Extended Info Panel" on each 'tab' has previously always been invisible/minimized. Now the 
	divider location is saved to the user temporary properties. This so we can remember how
	large the Extended Info Panel is for the 'Databases' or other Performance Counter tabs.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: all Performance Counters, right click menu</b><br>
	The context sensitive right click menu now has alternate column names and optional columns<br>
	This simply means that they will be enabled (available to click on) on more tabs.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Add Messages: Wait Event Dictionary</b><br>
	Added 5 new 'Wait Event Descriptions' from ASE Documentation 'Performance and Tuning Series: Monitoring Tables', Document ID 'DC00848-01-1570-01'<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>GUI Change: in all Performance Counters when reading offline database.</b><br>
	Previously the field 'Clear Time' was empty, this field is not visible in offline mode anymore<br>
	Instead a new field 'Head Time' is visible, so we can see that what head/main time this tab is 
	displaying, this makes it easier to detect if we are looking at the correct data.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: H2 PCS, Persist Counter Storage, connect properties</b><br>
	When recording a session in a H2 database, set some basic options if they are not part of the URL<br>
	<ul>
	    <li><code>DATABASE_TO_UPPER=false</code> - Do <b>not</b> convert Table and Column names to upper.</li>
	    <li><code>MAX_COMPACT_TIME=2000</code>   - The maximum time in milliseconds used to compact a database when closing.</li>
	</ul>
	Also setting some options in the database after connect<br>
	<ul>
	    <li><code>SET COMPRESS_LOB DEFLATE</code>       - Compress LOB Large OBjects, text/image fields.</li>
	    <li><code>SET DEFAULT_LOCK_TIMEOUT 15000</code> - Change the LOCK timeout to 15 seconds.</li>
	    <li><code>SET QUERY_TIMEOUT 15000</code>        - Change query timeout timeout to 15 seconds.</li>
	</ul>
	Also do '<code>SHUTDOWN COMPACT</code>' in method, stopServices()<br>
	The intention for these changes is that the database size will be smaller...<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>New: Tooltip on SPID, in offline mode for all Performance Counter</b><br>
	Tooltip on SPID in JTable cells now work in offline mode as well<br>
	First it loads the 'Processes tab', then it check if the SPID is there and reads all the information.<br>
	If the 'Processes' is not saved, then the ordinary 'Not able to load...' will be displayed.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Enhanced functionality: The offline/in-memory Slider can be moved with keyboard shortcuts.</b><br>
	The offline/in-memory Slider can now be moved using
	<ul>
		<li>Crtl+left or Ctrl+right for one tick at time</li>
		<li>Shift+left or Shift+right for 10 ticks at time</li>
		<li>Crtl+Shift+left or Ctrl+Shift+right move to next slot that has data</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changes to: Menu enable/disabled</b><br>
	Menus is now more context sensitive of what mode we are in. When connected etc, some menus will be enabled and disabled.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changes to: Disconnect</b><br>
	Now when we disconnect from ASE or the offline database, a dialog is popping up telling you what
	it for the moment is doing.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Add: include servername in Window Title</b><br>
	Show the ASE servername, or host:port number which this instance of AseTune is connected to<br>
	format: 'AseTune - SrvName - extra information string'<br>
	If we are NOT connected, no server name will be specified.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: Screen capture.</b><br>
	The text in the Dialog can now be Copy+Paste.<br>
	This makes it easier to access the storage directory.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: HostMonitor data type when storing counters</b><br>
	HostMonitor, expanded most data type storage from 7,1 or 5,1 to 10,1<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: ASE View Configuration Dialog</b><br>
	Some columns is now "editable", this simply means easier to do copy + paste<br>
	It does NOT mean, that you can change the configuration values...<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: Do graceful shutdown on Persistent Counter Handler</b><br>
	PCS try to do graceful shutdown, with "timeout" of 10 seconds.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: Main Window, Status Panel, added status for PCS Handler</b><br>
	Details about how many entries that are in the Different Persist Queues
	are now visible in the main window... a field with 3 counters has been added<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Change: Offline reader, read "User Defined Counters", UDC from offline DB</b><br>
	If the recorded database contains UDC, User Defined Counters that is NOT installed in the GUI
	simply create the UDC and add it to the GUI temporarily<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Upgraded some of the third party libraries/jars</b><br>
	<ul>
	  <li>To version 15.5 ESD#11, Component: jconn3.jar, jconn4.jar, jConnect Driver from JDK 15.5 ESD#11</li>
	  <li>To version 1.3.163, Component: H2 database</li>
	  <li>To version 15.7, Component: dsparser.jar, Sybase extension for reading interfaces, sql.ini files</li>
	  <li>To version 15.7, Component: planviewer.jar, Sybase extension to view showplan, used by dbisql.exe</li>
	  <li>To version 3.2.2, Component: jchart2d, Graph package</li>
	  <li>To version 4.2, Component: MigLayout, Layout Manager</li>
	  <li>To version 20111102, Component: proxy-vole, Access Internet Via WEB Proxy</li>
	  <li>To version 1.6.2-2, Component: swingx-core, JXTable...</li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Tab Databases</b><br>
	In offline mode, when reading the Performance Counters from the offline database, the local bar graph wasn't updated.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Tab Missing Statistics</b><br>
	This used to much CPU resources for checking if column was part of any index.<br>
	It uses a little less CPU now, but I still need to tune it in more detailed.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Tab Spinlock Sum</b><br>
	in pre 15.0 ASE, 'Arithmetic overflow occurred' could happen due to sum(many 'int' rows), now converting counters to numeric(12,0) before doing sum.<br>
	In ASE 15.0 and higher, convert to bigint is done<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Tab Processes</b><br>
	On highly utilized systems, timeouts happened. I guess this is due to joining with the monX proxy tables.<br>
	So now I snapshot monProcessActivity, monProcess, monProcessNetIO into temp tables and join from there.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Copy + Paste as 'Ascii Table' from JTables, now sorted</b><br>
	Now the copied table will be in the same sorted order as the JTable.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Tab Summary, Databases: Timeout when creating new databases.</b><br>
	Added 'readpast' to sub selects on sysdatabases & sysusages, this will hopefully just
	skipping reading this row from the ASE Version where locking schema 'datarows' has been 
	used for System tables. If I remember correctly this is ASE 15.x<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Performance Counter Tables, save/restore column layout</b><br>
	Previously only 1 layout was saved, so if we connected to several different ASE versions, this wasn't working very well<br>
	Now only column layout will be saved for each ASE Server version.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Tab Spinlock Sum, for ASE Cluster Edition</b><br>
	For cache partitions (cachelets) to many rows was returned, causing the "difference" calculation
	found "Duplicate key" and logged error messages about that.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: asetune.bat, problems with quote and backslash chars in Env Variables</b><br>
	problems if SYBASE was set to:
	<ul>
	    <li>set SYBASE="c:\Program Files\sybase"</li>
	    <li>set SYBASE="c:\Program Files\sybase\"</li>
	    <li>set SYBASE=c:\Program Files\sybase\</li>
	</ul>
	The trailing \ will be stripped, also the surrounding quotes...<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Persistent Counter Storage, Strings can be overflowed.</b><br>
	When storing to long Strings in the PCS, in H2 we got Exception: org.h2.jdbc.JdbcBatchUpdateException: Value too long for column<br>
	Solution: If the string we are going to store is "longer" that the database allowed storage size, then
	truncate the end of the string (the part of the string that we want be able to store), 
	and add '...' as a marker that is has been truncated.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Copy + Paste for to ascii table did not handle newLine.</b><br>
	Now the ascii table looks better if any "cell" has newlines in them<br>
	If this happens, I also add an extra vertical row separator, so it's easier to see where a new row starts<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: in offline mode, the filter 'column list' wasn't loaded.</b><br>
	This is now fixed<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: tab 'Objects': to many DuplicateKey errors/Exceptions.</b><br>
	Changed the internal PrimaryKey from: '<code>[InstanceID,] ObjectName, DBName, IndexID</code>' to: '<code>[InstanceID,] ObjectID, DBID, IndexID</code>'.<br>
	Hopefully this will cause to less DuplicateKey errors.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Problems to login</b><br>
	When a user logs in, I check for 'mon_role' (and 'sybase_ts_role'), if user doesn't have those roles
	I will try to automatically grant those roles, if current user is authorized to do this.<br>
	Fix: current user should have 'sso_role' not 'sa_role' to do automatic grant.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: check if connection is still open, done to often</b><br>
	This only means that the isOpen() check will hopefully already been done by the watchdog, which
	means that the GUI will not freeze or lag behind, because it's not the Swing Dispatch Thread that calls
	the database to check if the connection is still open.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>bug fix: Main Tabbed Pane, "tabs": Scroll/Wrap properties</b><br>
	If the Performance Counter 'tabs' doesnt fit on one row, do we want the tabs to "scroll" or "wrap"<br>
	Have all tabs on one row (scroll), or use multiple rows for 'tabs' (Wrap), Warpa is the default behaviour.<br>
	This was previously not saved and restored on AseTune restart, now it is<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>

	<b>Bug fix: Connecting to ASE</b><br>
	If $SYBASE was set, but "$SYBASE/ini" directory or "$SYBASE/ini/sql.ini" file didn't exist, the 
	Connection Dialog complained about: Connecting to a different ASE Version, This is NOT supported now...<br>
	This is now fixed.

	<b>Changes in: all "tabs" and the dialog "Change 'Performance Counter' Options..."</b><br>
	<ul>
	    <li>Query timeout can be changed in the "options" panel in each "tab".</li>
	    <li>A new column for Query Timeout has been added to the "Change 'Performance Counter' Options..." dialog.</li>
	    <li>New default value to 30 seconds on some Performance Counters that may take a lot of time, you'll find them in the above dialog.</li>
	</ul>

	<LI>
	<b>Change in: tab "missing stats"</b><br>
	The column list now also reflects if the specific column is part of any index, and the position within the index<br>
	column 'UpdStatDate' shows what data last update statistic was made on the table, 'not found' if statistics hasn't been updated at all.

	<LI>
	<b>Changes in: SQL Window</b><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Added template/completion for 'sp_helptext...'</li>

	<b>Changes in: When starting AseTune</b><br>
	The SYBASE environment variable is not mandatory anymore<br>
	On Windows: If AseTune can't find the 'sql.ini' file, a dummy one is created under '$HOME/.asetune/sql.ini'<br>
	On Unix: If AseTune can't find the 'interfaces' file, a dummy one is created under '$HOME/.asetune/interfaces'<br>
	HOME is get from: <code>System.getProperty("user.home");</code><br>
	In this file you can add you'r own servers if you like to.

	<b>Changes in: Performance Counter "Spinlock Sum"</b><br>
	Rewrote the query to use temporary tables for 'sysmonitors' instead of the "real" table.<br>
	This will hopefully be much faster, at least for ASE prior to ASE 15.0.2 
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Limitation: for Persistent Counter Storage, when using ASE earlier than 15.0</b><br>
	I wont allow pre 15.0 ASE servers to act as PCS. This because long table names are not allowed.<br>
	If you have any complaints about this, please inform me.<br>
	Also if the Page Size is less than 4K, I will issue a warning message saying that you may run 
	into problems. This because the PCS is probably storing wider rows than 1961 bytes.

	<b>Bug fix: All Performance Counter Collectors, Read timed out</b><br>
	When Exception: JZ006: Caught IOException: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out.<br>
	was raised in some cases, the GUI was simply blocked.<br>
	I added jConnect property 'QUERY_TIMEOUT_CANCELS_ALL=true', which sends a CANCEL request to the
	ASE server upon timeout Exceptions. I hope that this will fix most timeout hang situations.<br>
	If it doesn't, please do the following and send me the results.

	<b>Bug fix: AseTune need 'sa_role' to monitor anything in ASE 15.0.2 and above</b><br>
	This was due to the fact that I called ASE function <code>asehostname()</code>, which needs 'sa_role'.<br>
	This is now fixed.<br>
	Consequence: if you use ${ASEHOSTNAME} in the URL template when storing data in the Persistent Counter Storage, you will not get the asehostname(), instead you will get the @@servername

	<b>Changed behavior: Tooltip in JTable of Performance Counters are now focusable</b><br>
	By pressing F2 or by clicking in the text window.
	This means that you can now copy text from some tooltip windows. Especially good for Active Statements,
	so you can copy the showplan and SQL statements directly.<br>
	Also moved tooltip text from the JTable to be located on the "GUI tab" headers tooltip instead<br>
	The tooltip "describing highlighted rows" in the JTable was simply disturbing and was hiding the performance counters.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changed behavior: Tools-&gt;SQL Query Window </b><br>
	<ul>
	  <li>Added Syntax Highlight to the query text.</li>
	  <li>Simple code completion for some basic commands where added. (Ctrl+Space)</li>
	  <li>
		Show "what" SQL statement you are executing in a pop-up.<br>
		The pop-up will disappear when first result set arrives.<br>
	    This makes it easier to see what is happening when executing statements via pop-up 
	    menu ("right click") on JTables, for example some commands does take a substantial time, 
	    then we want to know what has been sent to the server.
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<LI>
	<b>Changed behavior: Tools-&gt;Capture SQL </b><br>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: The RepAgent collector, used a ASE 15.x syntax, which made ASE 11.5.4.x to break.</b><br>
	Solution: simply removing the optional text in: 'fetch [next from] cursor_name into @var'
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: PersistWriter</b><br>
	When a Performance Collector had no rows in it and had a Graph connected to it, we still tried to store the data, which cased some SQL syntax errors.<br>
	This was typically for a User Defined Collector, which grabbed info from a empty "trace" table.
	Solution: simply don't store Graph data with no rows in them.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: for CMactiveStatements, adding dependant role 'sybase_ts_role'</b><br>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: GetCounters thread, when checking for full transaction log in master database.</b><br>

	If the button is visible this Tab <b>has</b> Graphs attached. By clicking on the button, you can enable
	or disable the graphs attached to this Performance Counter Tab.
	Also in the "Summary" panel you have the Graph Button, right beside the label "Summary Panel",
	Click it to enable or disable graphs attached to the Summary Fields.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Added one field to the Summary panel, 'Full Transaction Logs'.</b><br>
	When there are databases that has full Transaction Logs, a red icon in the status bar shows up,
	telling you how many databases that has full transaction logs.<br>
	If you press the icon, you will jump to the 'Databases' tab.<br>
	In Databases Tab, databases with full transaction logs will be marked with a red background.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Bug fix: offline connect</b><br>
	If you connected to a "offline database" to view sampled performance counters,
	then you couldn't disconnect and connect to a new "offline database" without restarting the GUI.<br>
	This is now fixed. Some additional cleaning up could be done like: clearing the GUI, but then latest
	graphs that were loaded will also be cleared. So lets wait with the "full clean" a bit...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>nogui mode:</b><br> 
	Added <code>-f | --finish</code> switch, which shutdown or stop the no-gui service after # hours<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>nogui mode:</b><br> 
	Changed <code>-d | --dbname</code> switch, which specifies the offline URL string.<br>
	<code>-d|--dbname</code> Now accepts variables <code>${DATE}, ${SERVERNAME}, ${ASEHOSTNAME}, ${ASEMON_HOME}, ${ASEMON_SAVE_DIR}</code><br>
	<br>
	Explanation of the above variables<br>
		<ul>
		<li><code>${DATE[:format=fmt[;roll=true|false]]}</code><br>
		The DATE will be substituted with a timestamp, the format of the timestamp is specified by modifier 'format'.<br>
		<br>
		The DATE variable has modifiers, which means you can change the behaviour of the variable.<br>
		<ul>
			<li>modifier: "<code>format=formatSpecification</code>" Is how the DATE string should be built. the specification is according to <code>java.text.SimpleDateFormat</code>, and the default value is <code>yyyy-MM-dd</code></li>
			<li>modifier: "<code>roll=true|false</code>"            This means: start/create a new database if we roll over into a new DATE string. with format=<code>yyyy-MM-dd</code> a new DB will be created every midnight, with format=<code>yyyy-MM-dd_HH</code> a new DB will be created every hour. The default value for <code>roll</code> is <code>false</code>. </li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		The default value for <code>format</code> can be changed with in the Configuration file with property <code>PersistWriterJdbc.h2DateParseFormat=formatString</code> <br>
		The default value for <code>roll</code>   can be changed with in the Configuration file with property <code>PersistWriterJdbc.h2NewDbOnDateChange=true|false</code> <br>
			</li>
		<li><code>${SERVERNAME} </code> <br>
		The SERVERNAME will be substituted with the content of the ASE global variable <code>@@servername</code> of which ASE server we are monitoring.<br>
			</li>
		<li><code>${ASEHOSTNAME}</code> <br>
		The ASEHOSTNAME will be substituted with the output from ASE function <code>asehostname()</code> of which ASE server we are monitoring.<br>
			</li>
		<li><code>${ASEMON_HOME}</code> <br>
		The ASEMON_HOME will be substituted with the installation path of AseMon.<br>
			</li>
		<li><code>${ASEMON_SAVE_DIR}</code> <br>
		The ASEMON_SAVE_DIR will be substituted with ${ASEMON_HOME}/data or whatever the environment variable is set to.<br>
			</li>
		</ul>
	Example:<br>
	<code>asemon -Usa -Pnull -SGORAN_1_DS -uxyz -ppasswd -shost1 -n all -i 30 -D H2 -d xxx.${ASEHOSTNAME}.${DATE:format=yyyy-MM-dd.HH;roll=true}</code><br>
	The above example, does:
	<ul>
		<li>Connects to ASE 'GORAN_1_DS' with user 'sa'      <br><code>-Usa -Pnull -SGORAN_1_DS</code></li>
		<li>Host monitoring on host 'host1' with user 'xyz'  <br><code>-uxyz -ppasswd -shost1</code></li>
		<li>Samples all Performance Counters                 <br><code>-n all</code></li>
		<li>Sample every 30 seconds                          <br><code>-i 30</code></li>
		<li>Use H2 as the database storage                   <br><code>-D H2</code></li>
		<li>H2 dbname would be 'xxx.host1.2011-05-04.19' in current path. Every hour a new database will be created.
	                                                         <br><code>-d xxx.${ASEHOSTNAME}.${DATE:format=yyyy-MM-dd.HH;roll=true}</code></li>
	</ul>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Variables in URL</b><br>
	The variables <code>${DATE}, ${SERVERNAME}, ${ASEHOSTNAME}, ${ASEMON_HOME}, ${ASEMON_SAVE_DIR}</code>
	also works in the Connection Dialog in the "Counter Storage" tab.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>Changed the name of the error log.</b><br>
	For GUI mode: still ~/.asemon.AseMon.log<br>
	For NO-GUI mode: ~/.asemon.AseMon.nogui.log<br>
	Previously when running GUI and NO-GUI mode on same machine, they shared the error log.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>nogui mode:</b><br> 
	if you are using ASE to store the performance counters, then use DYNAMIC_PREPARE
	and do 'set statement_cache off', this for performance reasons.<br>
	NOTE: this is only done by specifying -D and -d switches for the moment.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>"offline-read" mode</b><br> 
	In "offline-read" mode, the "Offline Session Viewer" dialog checks for new Samples, which could arrive in the background.
	A Watermark in the dialog will tell you how many new samples that has been stored since last "refresh".
	Background storage of Performance Counters could for example be performed by the "no-gui" process if anyone has started that module.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	<b>nogui mode:</b><br> 
	Added <code>-r | --reconfigure</code> switch<br>
	This means that even if some ASE configuration options is not set, then configure them automatically. <br>
	Configuration names and there defaults is presented below.<br>
	It's only configuration options with a equal sign after, which automatically can be reconfigured.<br>

	<b>Basic Operating System Monitoring capabilities</b><br>
	Three new Tabs has been created for this:<br>
		<ul>
		<li><code>OS Disk Stat  </code> which uses iostat or vmstat to get OS disk statistics</li>
		<li><code>OS CPU(vmstat)</code> which uses vmstat to get OS overall OS statistics</li>
		<li><code>OS CPU(mpstat)</code> which uses mpstat to get OS statistics per CPU</li>
		</ul>
	The 'Operating System Monitoring' subsystem is using a SSH (Secure Shell) connection to remote host.
	In that SSH connection we can kick of the various OS Commands and receive the output (see below for more details)<br>
	<br>
	Below is a breath description of the subsystem<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
			What is this Basic Operating System Monitoring.<br>
			If you want to monitor the Operating System with some basic command, this is one way you can do it.<br>
			And also if you are storing the Performance Counters in a Persistent storage, the OS Monitoring is in sync with <br>
			the Performance Counters from the monitored ASE Server, which makes it easier to correlate the various metrics.
			</li>

			<li>
			What OS Monitoring Commands are supported for the moment.<br>
			The basic command which for the moment is supported is:
			<ul>
			  <li> <code> iostat </code></li>
			  <li> <code> vmstat </code></li>
			  <li> <code> mpstat </code></li>
			</ul>
			If you are using <b>Veritas</b> as the Disk IO subsystem and want to sample disk statistics with <b>vxstat</b> and not iostat.<br>
			Make sure <b>vxstat</b> is executable and in the <b>$PATH</b> off the user that you're connecting to the Operating System with.<br>
			Then it will execute <b>vxstat</b> instead of iostat and use that information.
			</li>

			<li>
			But every Operating System work slightly different.<br>
			But all Operating Systems has different layouts for the various commands. <br>
			For Example 'iostat' does not produce the same output on Solaris as it does on Linux. <br>
			<br>
			When a connection to the OS made, It will try to identify what OS were connecting to (by using uname -a) and then use OS specific parsers. <br>
			This implies that a \"parser\" is implement for every OS.<br>
			So if you are getting errors, faulty output or that your OS is not supported, please notify me and I will try to fix it.<br>
			Also if you want to change the parameters/flags to the OS Commands, to get better Performance Counters, kick me and I'll fix it!<br>
			<br>
			The only thing that can change by ourself is the OS Commands sleep interval<br>
			This is done by adding the below information to the configuration file. (asemon.properties)"
			<ul>
			  <li> for iostat: <code>MonitorIoSolaris.sleep=5</code></li>
			  <li> for mpstat: <code>MonitorVmstatAix.sleep=5</code></li>
			  <li> for vmstat: <code>MonitorMpstatLinux.sleep=5</code></li>
			</ul>
			You can probably fill in the blanks... <code>[Monitor][Subsystem][Osname].sleep=[samplePeriodToTheCommand]</code><br>
			<br>
			If you need to debug or check what the OS Command is sending, you can add the following to the Configuration file:<br>
			<code>log4j.logger.asemon.hostmon.HostMonitor=DEBUG</code><br>
			<br>
			Or you can use the 'log viewer' to change the 'log level' while AseMon is still running: <br>
			MainMenu-&gt;View-&gt;Open Log Window..., then Press 'Set log level'... locate asemon.hostmon.HostMonitor and change it.
			</li>

			<li>
			The big picture of how it's implememted.<br>
			The way it's implemented:<br>

			  <li> Start a background task that executes for instance 'iostat' every 2 seconds (iostat -xdz 2) or whatever sample period (see section above).</li>
			  <li> Parse the output from the OS Command and store it in a intermediate in-memory storage.</li>
			  <li> Then when AseMon think it's time to sample some Performance Counters (depends on AseMon's sample time)<br>
			       The subsystem does an <b>average</b> calculation on the intermediate stored values and then resets the intermidiate storage so that new samples from the OS Command can be sampled. <br>
			  <li> Now the Performance Counters or values are available to view in AseMon.</li>
			</ul>
			For 'vmstat' I choose a slightly different approach, this since 'vmstat' is only delivering one row per vmstats-sample period. <br>
			So in this case I do <b>not</b> do a summary or average calculation.<br>
			<br>
			Instead I simply displays <b>all</b> the sampled records I have received from the command with a 'timestamp' column to indicate when it was received.<br>
			If you instead want to have some kind of average or summary, please notify me and explain...
			</li>

			<li>
			What to expect in upcomming releases of AseMon.<br>
			In current release there are limited support for User Defined OS Monitoring, which you can add to the Configuration file<br>
			In future release, the plan is to add a <b>Wizard</b> where you can add User Defined Host Monitor Counters and maybe support for diff/rate counters as well.<br>
			<br>
			With a Used Defined OS Monitoring you could for example Monitor Outputs from <b>your</b> Application Server or in whatever way you think is's usable.<br>

	The work to port to Java Generics has been started...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Splash screen when starting.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Check for Java 6 version is done prior to starting asemon (in that bat/sh file)<br>
	This because in java 6, we are using the splash screen option, which is not available
	in earlier releases on java. If the version control is done later, then we will receive
	an error that the command line switch '-splash' is unknown...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	When switched to Java 1.6 and JXTable 1.6.2, the below started to happen:<br>
	When rows are deleted from a JTable, in some cases it used the "deleted" view row
	from the table to get cell values for rendering in some cases. <br>
	I don't know why this is happening, but it seems to happen in some repaint scenario
	when I have highlighters (in JXTable) + a bunch of more stuff...<br>
	A lot of the faults has been removed, but some are still left...<br>
	A ';' sign is printed to the standard output every time it happens. This just to notify
	me in the future, that the problem still exists...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: active statements<br>
	Added 2 columns 'HasMonSqlText' and 'MonSqlText', which does: <br>
	select SQLText from master..monProcessSQLText where SPID = &lt;SPID&gt;<br>
	This will show the current running SQL Statement, this will then also include
	SQL statements that has been executed via dynamic SQL inside a Stored procedure.
	exec('do SQL here'). In some cases/versions it's not showed by DBCC sqltext().<br>
	It will also help you to validate if the SQL statement is still running. Info from the
	monProcessSQLText only has rows if the statement is still running, while DBCC sqltext
	will show you the <b>last</b> executed SQL statement, which is still left in the PSS structure.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tabs: Process, Active Statements, Blocking<br>
	On SPID's that are blocked: Changed default color to PINK (almost read)
	</LI>

	<LI>
	In Memory History: the history time can now be set lower than the Graph History<br>
	A Spinner on the right of "Graph History in Minutes" is now available...<br>
	To access the "in memory history", press the "DB magnifyingGlass" icon on the toolbar.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Cell renders has been changed to format numbers in a better way.<br>
	Spaces between "large" numbers for readability.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Multiple column sorts can now be done (current implementation supports 3 columns).<br>
	The column header, has a indicator that tells you if the sort is done Ascending, Descending or Unsorted.
	The indicator also tells you if this column is the first, second or third column in the sort.<br>
	Initial Sort order (first click) has also been changed to Descending, so that high numbers is at top, because this is what we normally want to sort at.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Storing and Restoring of JTable Column Order, Visibility and Sort Order now works better.<br>
	Especially when viewing offline and in-memory data.<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Now also storing/restoring the filter panel on asemon restarts.<br>
	Also applying the filters when changing between	different data samples in the offline mode.
	also works when changing between InMemory view and Regular Online view.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Active Statements<br>
	Previously the MultiSampled flag was raised when the SPID was present between two samples.<br>
	Now that check also includes in the StartTime for the statement is the same.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	ASE Configuration (both sp_configure, sp_helpcache and sp_cacheconfig) are stored in the
	Persistent Counter Storage (a offline database) when asemon starts.<br>
	The configuration can be viewed from the GUI when reading the offline database.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	New Tab: Procedure Call Stack<br>
	This will show the nesting level of how the procs/triggers/views are executed.<br>
	This could be used as a small profiler, to check what procedure stack is currently executing,
	but to make it into a better profiler this needs to be sampled *often*, which might not be a good idea...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	New graphs:<br>
	<UL type="circle">
	<LI>CPU Summary using global variables @@cpu_busy, @@cpu_io (depends on tab 'Summary')</LI>
	<LI>Number of transactions (only in ASE 15.0.3 ESD#1 and higher) (depends on tab 'Summary')</LI>
	<LI>Number of Connections/users that are connected to the ASE (depends on tab 'Summary')</LI>
	<LI>Disk read/write per second using global variables @@total_read, @@total_write (depends on tab 'Summary')</LI>
	<LI>Network Packet read/sent per second using global variables @@pack_recv, @@pack_sent (depends on tab 'Summary')</LI>
	<LI>Checkpoint and Housekeeper Writes per second (depends on tab 'Processes')</LI>
	<LI>Number of Procedure Requests per Second (depends on tab 'Procedure Cache')</LI>
	</UL>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Engines<br>
	in ASE 15.5 the column 'IO CPU Time' was added to the monEngine table... <br>
	Start to use that one, otherwise the percentage calculation will be wrong.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Number of tabs has started to be a factor... it becomes harder to navigate between them.<br>
	So now you can hide tabs that you are not using, or simply reorder the tabs to suit your usage of asemon.<br>
	Right click on any tab, and choose 'Tab Options', in here you can personalize the tabs a bit.<br>
	Or from the main menu: View -&gt; Change 'Tab Titles' Order and Visibility <br>
	The second thing that has been done on tab navigation is: on the toolbar two new buttons has
	been added where you can Activate (jump to) a specific tab. One button is in the original order,
	the second button is sorted on the tab title name.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	New Tab: sp_monitorconfig<br>
	This simply executes the procedure sp_monitorconfig, which could be handy to have<br>
	Recommendation is to have the 'postpone' field set to 600 (10 minutes or so), so we do not sample this that often.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Saving the active graphs in the Summary panel, did not work, fixed that...<br>
	So now after a restart I remember what graphs was active or disabled.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	File Location changes:<br>
	Temporary GUI save settings file (asemon.save.properties), "screen capture" files and log files
	directory has been moved from ($HOME) to ($HOME/.asemon)
	</LI>

	<LI>
	When the expire date for the in-development release a GUI pop up is showed.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Processes<br>
	The local option "Show System Processes" did not work on some ASE versions, this was fixed
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Active Objects: In some cases (for example "self joins"), the object/table was
	presented several times by the MDA tables, which caused this tab to fail.<br>
	This has been fixed in the following way: if several rows with the same PK is found,
	and we have a column that is named 'dupMergeCount', we simply merge the previous found
	row with the current one (simulate a sum()) and increment the column 'dupMergeCount',
	the last thing is done just to specify how many rows we actually merged into this row.<br>
	If 'dupMergeCount' is above 0, then we will have several rows summarized into this row.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Command line parameters: A couple of new ones has been introduced<br>
	For example: -U user -P passwd -S server -s sampleTime -d h2dbname <br>
	These switches is mainly for the --noGui option (override values in the noGui config file)<br>
	If you have not produced a noGui config file via the "offline wizard" you can now choose
	to specify --NoGui small|medium|large|all, which collects a predefined subset of
	Performance Counters into the Persistent Counter Storage.<br>
	If you want full control over what to collect, please use the "offline wizard" to specify
	what Performance Counters that should be collected.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Blocking<br>
	Fixed so that it can contain multiple PK (this since no difference calculations is done in this tab)
	</LI>

	<LI>
	The pop up dialog informing you about "out of memory" situations,
	now the OK button works to close the window
	</LI>

	<LI>
	The tooltip on column header does not work in offline mode.<br>
	The solution was to store the MDA help dictionary stuff in the offline database, and read
	it in again when connection to a offline database.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	In earlier releases the ESD level was reset to 0 or 1 when it was over 9<br>
	Now the max ESD level is keept at 9, so even if you running ESD#10 it will
	show as #9 in the internal integer holding ase version.<br>
	This will be redone in later some later release, using better granularity of the version number.<br>
	Also ESD number handling was changed in some release to support "sub ESD levels",
	so a @@version string can now look like (Adaptive Server Enterprise/12.5.4/EBF 15400 ESD#7.1/P/...) <br>
	The parsing for this does now work, but I do not keep track of the ESD sub level.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Cached Procedures<br>
	Now has a Icon, which tells you what type of object it is (rule, view, trigger or procedure)
	</LI>

	<LI>
	When asemon connect to ASE it puts the asemon version into the sysprocesses.host field
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Active Statements<br>
	new option: get procedure call stack, which also gets the procedure call stack from the table monProcessProcedures
	</LI>

	<LI>
	SQL Window Tool, add icon so it's visible in the "taskbar" in windows.<br>
	This makes it easier to navigate between many different SQL Windows...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	When in the in-memory view, the previous versions still updated the 'Summary' panel.<br>
	This is not done anymore.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	A Dummy/Demo test application has been made, so you can "simulate" workload towards an ASE Server
	and train yourself how to use asemon.<br>
	This is the file perfdemo.bat<br>
	To be able to use this you must install a test/demo database, see README.txt and DO_DEMO.txt in classes/asemon/perftest/sql for more information<br>
	My intention was not to release this application, I created it simply to do "dummy load"
	on the ASE server during a customer demo that I gave, but you might also be able to use it,
	please give me some feedback if it should be included in the package or if I should be deleted.<br>
	So the README.txt and DO_DEMO.txt files are just my internal notes...

	<LI>
	A bunch of bug fixes and improvements not listed here
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Processes<br>
	The choice to disable sampling of "system threads".<br>
	In ASE Cluster Edition, there are a bunch of system threads/SPID's, which could
	blur the vision in this tab.<br>
	For now; this was implemented using SQL, but in the future it might very well be
	a "filter" option instead. Then we would still benefit from the "Persistence Counter Storage"
	to store all threads in the database (if we were using that), but when later when viewing
	data we could filter them out in the GUI.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Query Window:<br>
	When doing "ctrl-c" to copy into the clipboard in some places the new-line was not copied.<br>
	A "copy" button was also implemented that takes "all" the objects in the result set output
	and put it into the clipboard, JTables are coped into ASCII tables.
	keys: F5, F9 are now shortcuts to execute SQL, this to emulate dbisql<br>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	You can now Pause all data collection by pressing the 'Pause icon' on the tool bar or
	the 'Pause Icon' in the status field. To resume data collection, just press the same icon gain,
	which now will have a 'Play icon'.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Added dbcc pss(0, ${SPID}, 2) on the right click in all tables.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Engines<br>
	Only select records from monEngines with the Status 'online'.<br>
	Also a new column 'IOCPUTime' was added if you're above ASE 15.5 and 15.0.3 CE<br>
	NOTE: it's currently not part of the percentage calculation.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	For ASE Cluster Edition, remember the system_view settings (cluster or instance)<br>
	The system view can be changed in the 'Summary' tab if you are connected to a ASE CE.

	<LI>
	Login dialog: when pressing enter in the password field and all the mandatory fields are filled in

	Screen shots can now be made from a button on the tool bar, using the "Camera icon".<br>
	It will produce a JPG file in the "home" directory.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Objects when we are in 15.5 and 15.0.3 CE, I have added a bunch of new columns, mainly for
	Cluster Edition measurements...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	In the 'Summary' tab I also grabs @@connections and an 15.5 or 15.0.3 CE I also get Transactions
	from the monState table. (in CE the Transactions columns does not seem to work in a good manner)
	</LI>

	<LI>
	When there are blocking spid's, a red icon in the status bar shows up, telling you how many
	spid's that are currently blocked. If you press the icon, you will jump to the 'Blocking' tab.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	If you're running out of memory, I will try to clear all in memory history and do
	Garbage Collection. After the GC hopefully enough memory will be available to continue.<br>
	TODO: I show a blocking message, this needs to changed into a non blocking message.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	An all tabs: a User Defined SQL statement for tool tip on cell content can be added<br>
	This is done in the config file, example:<br>
	table.tooltip.SPID=select * from sysprocesses where spid = ?<br>
	table.tooltip.CMprocActivity.SPID=select suser_name(suid) from sysprocesses where spid = ?<br>
	The first config would execute SQL and show the result set as a tool tip in all tab's<br>
	The second will override the default when you are in tab 'CMprocActivity'.<br>
	For SPID there is a default tool tip that shows some info from monProcess
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Tab: Active Statements<br>
	A spid that holds blocking locks, may not always be visible in monProcessStatement<br>
	For example id you in isql do 'begin tran; insert into t1 values(1); go', the spid will
	be in status 'waiting for incoming network data' and not really active.<br>
	There for I introduced two set of rows 'ACTIVE' and 'BLOCKER', the 'ACTIVE' originates from
	monProcessStatement, while 'BLOCKERS' are spid's that blocks others from working. Both the
	'ACTIVE' and the 'BLOCKER' can be visible in the table.<br>
	Also added 'dbcc stacktrace' of all spid's visible in this table<br>
	The ability to disable 'showplan', 'sqltext' and 'stacktrace' can be done from the GUI
	and is written to the user settings temporary property file as
	'CMActiveStatements.sample.showplan=false, CMActiveStatements.sample.dbccSqltext=false, CMActiveStatements.sample.dbccSqltext=false'.<br>
	Also added column 'BlockingOtherSpids' which is a list of spid's that the current spid is blocking,
	and by the way, rows/spid's that blocks other will be marked with the color red.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	bugfix: User Defined Counter wizard, name checking was partially faulty.<br>
	Name can now only be a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and not starting with CM.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Added 'needRole' to CounterModel and UserDefinedCounterModel, which will be checked
	just as 'needConfig' and show errors on the 'tab' if you are not authorized to view
	the 'tab'.<br>
	Also added a bunch of stuff so that non 'sa' users can use the tool as well.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Better support for command line switches. This is now done in java instead of
	the bat or shell script that starts asemon.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Made changes in the ConnectionDialog to support JDBC options + a JdbcOptionDialog
	where you can choose from the JDBC driver provided options. Or simply type them in manually<br>
	Also multiple host:port are fetched from the sql.ini/interfaces file and can also be
	typed in manually. However jConnect doesn't seem to like it...<br>
	If the information which is
	you can switch to use the "raw" URL mode instead, check the 'Use URL' check box, then
	the URL text field will be used when connection. By pressing &lt;enter&gt; in the field the
	URL text will be parsed and transferred to the above disabled fields.

<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2010-02-22</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
	Added "sp_showplan" and "dbcc sqltext" in tab 'Active Statements'. <br>
	The full showplan text is displayed using tool tip. Or copy the table using
	right click 'copy table to clipboard'.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Added 'Data Type' in the Create 'User Defined Counter' Wizard.<br>
	If it's not a number datatype, the column can't be chosen as a 'diff' counter<br>
	Also added some checks in the Graph part, so that we can't continue, if wrong
	method type is chosen (if diff is not on, only absolute methods can be chosen)

	If you are on a slow connection to the dataserver, it will now work faster.<br>
	I removed a lot of extra calls to Connection.isClosed(), which issues 'exec sp_mda 0,7'
	to check if the connection is alive or not. I simply cached the check for X milliseconds.

	Asemon now works with ASE Cluster Edition<br>
	The column InstanceId has been added in the case we connects to a Cluster Enabled ASE.
	Some extra information is also displayed in the 'Summary' tab. In this panel you can also
	choose if you want to view counters for the whole cluster or just the instance which
	asemon is connected to.<br>
	Specific Counter Tab's will probably added later on, but for now create you'r own Cluster
	Specific counters using the wizard 'create User Defined Counter', please send you'r best
	Cluster Edition Counters to me so I can implement them for everyone.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Added Counter tab 'Sysmon Raw' which works in peer with 'Spinlock Sum'.<br>
	This counter is in extreme first version, and just reads the values that was left over
	from the 'Spinlock Sum' counter tab. No enrichment of the data has be done so far, so
	it's just the "raw" counters that the sp_sysmon is using.<br>
	In the future a sp_sysmon look alike can be done (lets use a JXTreeTable for that).

	Implemented "offline" reader<br>
	This means that we now can read data from a database into the GUI, the data has previously
	been stored by asemon into that database (Persistent Counter Storage).<br>
	The sampled data could have been stored by the "non gui" mode or by the GUI itself,
	and viewed at a later time.<br>
	This functionality also enables us to have <b>one</b> "no gui" asemon that stores the data
	in the Persistent Counter Storage and <b>many</b> asemon GUI's that views the data.<br>
	That is if several dba's wants to view the same data without having several asemon GUI's
	that each individually issues SQL statements to collect data.<br>
	Please I need feedback on how this is working...
	</LI>

	<LI>
	A green "line/stripe" at the right hand side of the tab on the TabbedPane, which
	indicates that there are sampled data under that tab.<br>
	This needs rework, because it overwrites menu items, tool tip and other components
	that are displayed on top of the "stripe" indicator.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	In the Persistent Counter Storage, you can now choose if you want to store <b>all</b>
	data or just some of them, you can choose to store Absolute, Diff or Rate Counters in
	the data store.<br>
	There are check boxes for this in each counter panel and also in the Wizard that creates
	an file for the off line storage.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	If we loose the database connection to the monitored server in GUI mode, it tries to
	automatically reconnect if the option is set in the Connection dialog.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	Menu-&gt;view-&gt;Set Counter Set Parameters<br>
	Is a new Dialog where you can change most of the options that is normally located
	under each "tab". This means that you do not have to click around so much when you want
	to change some option under <b>all</b> the various tabs.

	The graphs are now zoomable. Just drag the mouse over the are you want to zoom in on.

	<LI>
		two new tabs 'System Load' and 'Temp Db'<br>
		'System Load' needs ASE 15.5 or higher and shows information from the monSysLoad, which can help you

		A word of warning so for: The transaction log in the master database will/could fill up due to
		a bug in ASE where missing statistics on <code>mon*</code> tables is updated in <code>master..sysstatistics</code><br>
		A stored procedure <code>sp_missing_stats</code>, which (for now) will have to be manually

		For the filter "Do not show unchanged counter rows" I added the abbility
		to dissregard some columns. So even if it's a diff counter and it's NOT
		zero it will still filtered out that column.<br>
		This is good for "WaitTime" column in the "Processes" tab. Because it's

			<LI> The TabbedPane has been rewritten to do "dock/undock" tabs into windows and
				 right click popups on the Tabbs that handles more stuff.
			<LI> now using MigLayout as it's Gui layout manager
			<LI> Using JXTable instead of JTable
			<LI> Sorting is done by JXTable
			<LI> Filtering is done by JXTable
			<LI> Highlighting/Color setting is done by JXTable (in JTable this is CellRenderer)
			<LI> right-click on the table now uses 'xmenu', which is specified in the config file

		Sometimes that graphs did not get updated in the summary panel.
		This was a timing problem, when data is captured, it's done with
		it's own thread. If the "get data" thread was not complete before

		Major thing is NO-GUI mode is configurable and can persist the
		counters in a JDBC session. (ASE and H2 has been tested)
		H2 would be the preferred option. This so we can store the
		counters in another server/database store than the one we
		pulling out data from. Using the H2 DB it would also be
		easier to sample ASE counters on Unix systems and later on
		view them on a Windows machine.
	</LI>

	<LI>
		some changes to "capture SQL" tool.
