<UL>
	<LI>
		Move CountersModel into asemon.cm package this also implicates
		splitting GetCounters all "sub classes" and make them into
		"proper" java classes. Why: the GetCounters starts to get BIG
	<LI>
		More "save props" for graphs and TabCntrPanels
	<LI>
		The OFF-LINE MODE. Meaning view persisted counters...
		- Add Off-Line Connect dialogue
	<LI>
		Work more on the Spinlock panel... set descriptions for known
		spinlocks, fix the renderer so it indicates high values with
		RED color or similar.
	<LI>
		Configuration now has getProps() and getSaveProps() why not put
		them together for "read" so it reads: system->props->saveProps
		and when we saveProps we only save them into the saveProps
		because we do not want to write in the "config" file...
		Meaning different level of config read...
	<LI>
		Cleanup all the classes that are not used today...
	<LI>
		Save more GUI stuff in the saveProps. have a "tab" been "un-docked"
		into its own window, what was the x,y position.
		Should the graph(s) be active or disabled.
	<LI>
		Menu->view->"Configure" What tabs should be visible and some
		configurations for each tab in a "list" form.
		Example: Show on Tab[x], Persist To Off-line (abs[x] diff[x] rate[x])
	<LI>
		Persister: if table destination table exists: check if all the
		desired columns are in the table (if not, alter table add column...)
	<LI>
		Try to get HOST CPU usage in it's own Tab
		(and if possible disk IO statistics)


	<LI>
		New Properties/Preferences Dialog which looks like the Eclipse one...
	<LI>
		SQL Capture: Right click menu on tables, redo the GUI and code
	<LI>
		Make copy to clipboard a bit better
	<LI>
		Validate that the OFF Line works as it should after this major re-code
	<LI>
		CounterModel redo the code, it's pritty uggly for the moment
	<LI>
		Options panel: make all CM properties editable (a good overview) of all the CM's that are configured.
	<LI>
		Implement the lock tool
	<LI>
		Integrate 'dbisql' into various places... dbisql has good perf & tuning output.<br>
		Right now it's in SQL Window, but it needs to be in more places.
	<LI>
		OFF-Line: Store only the specified capture set (ABS, DIFF or RATE)
	<LI>
		WIZARD: create a wizard that creates a new UserDefined CM...
	<LI>
		A new permanent CM that checks mon"CurrentExecutingSQL and statements... this is a complement to capture SQL
	<LI>
		OFF-Line: make a "Capture SQL" that works for off-line as well
