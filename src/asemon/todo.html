		Move CountersModel into asemon.cm package this also implicates
		splitting GetCounters all "sub classes" and make them into
		"proper" java classes. Why: the GetCounters starts to get BIG
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Work more on the Spinlock panel... set descriptions for known
		spinlocks, fix the renderer so it indicates high values with
		RED color or similar.
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Configuration now has getProps() and getSaveProps() why not put
		them together for "read" so it reads: system->props->saveProps
		and when we saveProps we only save them into the saveProps
		because we do not want to write in the "config" file...
		Meaning different level of config read...
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Cleanup all the classes that are not used today...
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Save more GUI stuff in the saveProps. have a "tab" been "un-docked"
		into its own window, what was the x,y position.
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Persister: if table destination table exists: check if all the
		desired columns are in the table (if not, alter table add column...)
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Try to get HOST CPU usage in it's own Tab
		(and if possible disk IO statistics)<br>
		This will be done by agents running on the host OS. The agents them self would be hosted
		in the asemon.jar, and listens on a port (via jTDS3.jar) and returns a pre-defined 
		result set that asemon knows how to read.<br>
		There could be various implementations for the different OS and IO subsystems, for example
		if the customer uses Veritas we need to use vxstat to get service times on the disks... <br>
		This can also be done with SSH connection to the destination host...
	</LI>



	<LI>
		New Properties/Preferences Dialog which looks like the Eclipse one...
	</LI>

	<LI>
		SQL Capture: Right click menu on tables, redo the GUI and code
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Make copy to clipboard a bit better
	</LI>

	<LI>
		CounterModel redo the code, it's pritty uggly for the moment
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Implement the lock tool
	</LI>

	<LI>
		Integrate 'dbisql' into various places... dbisql has good perf & tuning output.<br>
		Right now it's in SQL Window, but it needs to be in more places.
	</LI>

	<LI>
		OFF-Line: make a "Capture SQL" that works for off-line as well
	</LI>
