<h1>History of what has been done so far</h1>



<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2009-03-31</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		Checking for updates on the net (but I need to change the web address later)<br>
		But I need to implement the web page for new downloads etc...
	<LI>
		Re-coded MainFrame and moved to GUI<br>
	<LI>
		Trendgraph<br>
		- setChartMaxHistoryTimeInMinutes() could get garbled.<br>
		- Add dummypoint when not connected to avoid NPE from ToolTip.
		- also moved TrendGraph
</UL>


<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2009-03-26</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		Capture SQL on the right click menu
	<LI>
		Copy table information to clipboard (but: needs more work)
	<LI>
		Changed a bunch of the Icons and added icons to the GTabbedPane, 
		right click menu, goto tab.
	<LI>
		SQL Window can now show graphical showplan views (same as dbisql).<br>
		Some graphical changes as well, print/raiserror messages now comes
		in-line with the result sets (priviously it was just at the end)<BR>
		You can also select cells to copy+paste values from.<br>
		Messages are now also copy+paste enabled. 
	<LI>
		Using MigLayout in summary panel for graphs now, which makes it a bit
		nicer for resizing... the graphs grows in height now as well.
	<LI>
		For the filter "Do not show unchanged counter rows" I added the abbility
		to dissregard some columns. So even if it's a diff counter and it's NOT
		zero it will still filtered out that column.<br>
		This is good for "WaitTime" column in the "Processes" tab. Because it's
		always contains values... I still want to see the diff/rate values.
		But I don't want to use them (as valid values) in the filter check.
	<LI>
		The filter "Do not show unchanged counter rows" has also been moved from
		the Options panel to the Filter panel, where it really resides.<br> 
		This also made me move the "Counter Type" panel one snap left...
	<LI>
		Selected row in the table is still selected after a "data refresh"
		and hopefully it's the same row even if it has changed location
		due to resort of the new/refreshed data...
	<LI>
		MainFrame - status panel (at bottom) now has Memory information<br>
		This class will be needed to recode soon - the code is ugly...
	<LI>
		If data collection is paused, a watermark text will inform you
		about the Pause...
	<LI>
		The AboutBox panel now contains<br>
		- History<br>
		- Todo<br>
		- System Properties<br>
</UL>


<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2009-03-16</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		Moved the negativeDiffCounters to Zero so we can choose this
		for each panel....
	<LI>
		Added icons for the TableCntrPanel and most of the CM's
	<LI>
		Some small changes on the xmenu stuff.
</UL>


<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2009-03-13</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		ALOT OF THINGS WHERE DONE
	<LI>
		Moved a lot of files around, the goal is that all GUI components should be in 'gui' package

	<LI>
		Configuration.java: moved to utils package, and added encrypt/decrypt of passwords
	<LI>
		AseMonitoringConfig -> gui.AseMonitoringConfigDialog: remade gui layout
	<LI>
		CountersModel Made it a TableModel... there is a lot more needed to be done on this one
		and that will be done in next check-in
	<LI>
		A new dictionary for displaying ToolTip on WaitEventId
	<LI>
		Moved Version information into its own class 'Version.java'
	<LI>
		The ConnectionDialog has been totally rewritten
	<LI>
		Auto login ability on startup
	<LI>
		A logAppender for log4j that has a Gui Window so we can look at the errorlog graphically
		and also change the log level "on the fly", but the log level is not saved into the
		properties file. We only want to change it during this session.
	<LI>
		Total new Dialog for changing some small properties (only Refresh rate for now)
	<LI>
		A new 'Query window' has been added to the MainFrame menu. This will open a GUI 'isql'
	<LI>
		TabularCntrPanel has been rewritten:
		<UL>
			<LI> The TabbedPane has been rewritten to do "dock/undock" tabs into windows and
				 right click popups on the Tabbs that handles more stuff.
			<LI> now using MigLayout as it's Gui layout manager
			<LI> Using JXTable instead of JTable
			<LI> Sorting is done by JXTable
			<LI> Filtering is done by JXTable
			<LI> Highlighting/Color setting is done by JXTable (in JTable this is CellRenderer)
			<LI> right-click on the table now uses 'xmenu', which is specified in the config file
				so now it's really easy to add your own right click menu items.
				Default menu items is 'stored proc text, sp callstack, optdiag, sp_help, sp_spaceused...'
		</UL>
	<LI>
		A bunch of new icons has been added
	<LI>
		AboutBox total rewrite
	<LI>
		And a lot more small stuff
	<LI>
		NOTE: A lot more is needed to be changed and cleanup, so this is just a partial check-in.
	<LI>
		Reine Changed TrendGraph to use JChart2D instead of JFreeChart, this due to
		performance reasons when we had *long* "Graph History Time".
		This was merged in from the "trunk".
</UL>



<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2009-02-12</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		Multiple ResultSets is now handled
	<LI>
		Watermark on the summary graphs is now on the scroll panel,
		this makes the watermark more center of the view/what we see...
</UL>



<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2009-02-03</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		User Defined Graph can be added
		this probably needs more work, but for now it's "ok"...
	<LI>
		SummaryPanel was "redesigned" and moved to GUI package
	<LI>
		Default ASEMon Icon was changed (added more blue on the table)
</UL>



<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2009-01-23</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		Sometimes that graphs did not get updated in the summary panel.
		This was a timing problem, when data is captured, it's done with
		it's own thread. If the "get data" thread was not complete before
		we wanted to update the graphs, the graphs was not updated.
		So now I wait for the "get data thread" to complete before continue.
	<LI>
		The Toolbar was added.
	<LI>
		The first glans at "offline setup wizard" was created (need more work here)
	<LI>
		Changed the j4log from 1.2.8 -> 1.2.15
	<LI>
		Some small stuff as well
	<LI>
		Default ASEMon Icon was changed
</UL>



<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2008-10-31</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		Fixed bug in summary panel counte. If ASE listens to several networks
		only show the first "min()" listener. otherwise the subquery will fail...
	<LI>
		Added Wrap/Scroll capability in the TabPanel
</UL>



<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2008-10-27</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		Fixed bug in engine average calculation...
		in version X i changed getRateValueAvg to discard 0.0 as "rows"
		this was to support the Average Service Time in DeviceIO graph better.
		But now I'm using getRateValueAvgGtZero instead.
	<LI>
		Added the "WATER MARK" text to TabularControlPanel and SummaryPanel
		to easier know what is happening behind the scenes... are we connected...
	<LI>
		Added some descriptions for Tooltip on the TABS.
	<LI>
		added methods: isMonConnected(), getMonConnection() this will hopefully
		be used to distinguish between OFF-Line mode and ON-Line mode.
</UL>



<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2008-10-24</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		Added this "version history" comment
	<LI>
		Doing "late initialization" of CountersObject, which means that
		we can create the GUI graphics and decide later what SQL statement to
		use dependent on what version the ASE Server is of.
	<LI>
		Took away a lot of static variables in GetCounters and MainFrame
</UL>



<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>2008-10-16</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		Major thing is NO-GUI mode is configurable and can persist the
		counters in a JDBC session. (ASE and H2 has been tested)
		H2 would be the preferred option. This so we can store the
		counters in another server/database store than the one we
		pulling out data from. Using the H2 DB it would also be
		easier to sample ASE counters on Unix systems and later on
		view them on a Windows machine.
	<LI>
		some changes to "capture SQL" tool.
	<LI>
		saving more options in the "save props" file!
	<LI>
		And a lot more small things.
</UL>


<!-- ========================================================================== -->
<H2>200x-xx-xx</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		Started from asemon 0.96 by Jean-Paul Martin<BR>
		Redone a whole lot of things
	<LI>
		Automatic resize of columns headers in tables
	<LI>
		Cell renders are not dependent on Object type, but it's now
		using method calls to decide what to do when rendering.
	<LI>
		Do not remember all things I did back then
</UL>
